Justification for Deviation from Divisional Architecture Principles
1. Low Deviation
Definition: Minor deviations from divisional architecture principles that have a negligible or no impact on system performance, scalability, security, or overall strategic alignment. These deviations are temporary and unlikely to result in long-term architectural risk.

Justification:

Temporary Workaround: A short-term solution implemented to address a specific migration or integration requirement, which will be addressed in a future release or phase.
Non-Critical Variance in Technology Selection: A deviation in the choice of technology or tool due to immediate business needs that doesn’t contradict core architectural principles. For example, a different cloud service or integration pattern used to meet business needs but will be aligned with divisional standards during future phases.
Minimal Impact: The deviation does not compromise security, scalability, performance, or operational stability. It has no effect on compliance, and there is a clear path for future alignment.
Business Continuity Consideration: Deviation is necessary to maintain business continuity while other more critical architectural elements are being migrated or transitioned.
Proven Control Measures: Controls or monitoring are in place to ensure that the deviation will not result in any unforeseen issues.
2. Moderate Deviation
Definition: Deviations that introduce a certain level of risk or impact on the architectural integrity or operational performance, but can be mitigated effectively with planned actions. These deviations may affect some aspects of the system but do not critically impact security, compliance, or scalability.

Justification:

Temporary Architectural Adjustments: Necessary deviations from divisional principles to accommodate the current technological landscape or migration process, such as temporary local copies of data that will later be fully migrated to Snowflake.
Integration Challenges: The second migration process has introduced challenges where immediate alignment with divisional standards is impractical or would delay the overall migration. For example, certain integrations may require non-standard solutions that will eventually be aligned with the architecture.
Technology Gap: Some legacy systems or dependencies force deviations from divisional technology standards, but they have a clear roadmap for transitioning to divisional-approved technologies.
Operational Workaround: Local copies of data or hybrid solutions have been implemented to ensure business continuity and system performance but are being actively worked on to be fully integrated or standardized.
Planned Mitigation Strategy: A roadmap is in place with clear milestones for realigning with divisional principles, with defined timelines and accountable owners to ensure successful mitigation of the deviation.
3. High Deviation
Definition: Significant deviations that create moderate-to-high risks to the divisional architecture principles. These deviations impact the overall performance, scalability, maintainability, or security of the system, and require active management and oversight to prevent long-term negative consequences.

Justification:

Non-Standard Integration or Architecture: The migration approach relies on non-standard data integration processes or cloud services that are not part of the divisional architecture. For example, hybrid cloud-local architectures may introduce data latency, inconsistent availability, or operational complexity.
Data Availability and Synchronization Issues: Some data tables or datasets are not fully aligned between the cloud and local copies, leading to data consistency and availability challenges. This may affect reporting or analytics processes that rely on fully integrated data.
Performance or Scalability Risks: Deviations from divisional architecture principles, such as unconventional storage or processing solutions, may impact the scalability or performance of the system in the long run. The system may not scale as effectively as per the divisional standards, introducing operational inefficiencies.
Technology Evolution Delays: The deviation may be due to evolving technologies that have not yet been incorporated into the divisional strategy but may delay alignment with the overall divisional technology stack.
Increased Operational Risk: There is a higher level of operational complexity or risk to system maintenance and governance due to the deviation. This could be in the form of needing specialized skills or increased monitoring for the non-standard components.
Escalated Cost of Mitigation: The time and effort required to align with divisional standards are considerable, and the deviation incurs higher long-term costs or requires substantial resource allocation to address.
4. Critical Deviation
Definition: Severe deviations from divisional architecture principles that create substantial risks to system stability, security, compliance, performance, or scalability. These deviations pose major challenges to the organization's long-term architectural strategy and require immediate corrective action.

Justification:

Complete Bypass of Core Principles: The architectural principles have been significantly bypassed, and the resulting solution may present long-term risks to the organization's ability to scale, maintain, or secure its IT environment. For example, a fundamental shift in data storage or processing that contradicts the divisional strategy for cloud-first or standardization initiatives.
Unresolved Data Consistency Issues: Severe inconsistencies between local copies of data and the Snowflake cloud environment, leading to potential issues with reporting, analytics, or operational workflows. These inconsistencies create significant risks to data integrity and business decision-making processes.
Security or Compliance Risks: The deviation introduces critical security vulnerabilities or violates key compliance requirements, such as data sovereignty, privacy, or regulatory standards. For instance, data might be stored in non-compliant or unsupported cloud environments, creating a potential compliance breach.
Long-Term Technical Debt: The deviation creates significant long-term technical debt due to reliance on non-standard tools, services, or integrations. This prevents future scalability, increases complexity, and may result in future maintenance challenges.
Failure to Meet Business Needs: The current architecture is unable to support the business’s core processes due to the deviation, resulting in operational inefficiencies, higher risks of system failure, or inability to meet the organization's service-level agreements (SLAs).
Lack of Alignment with Organizational Strategy: The solution represents a fundamental misalignment with the broader IT and divisional strategy, hindering future growth and preventing seamless future integration with other organizational systems.
Urgency for Remediation: The deviation poses an immediate threat to core business operations, requiring immediate corrective action. The risk of failure or non-compliance requires rapid intervention to realign with divisional principles.
