IT technology dependancy

Low Dependency
Justification:

The systems or technologies categorized as Low Dependency are non-critical to day-to-day operations and have minimal impact on business processes if they experience temporary downtime or disruption.
These systems are often peripheral or auxiliary in nature, supporting non-core functions or providing services that are not time-sensitive.
Migration or system changes can be scheduled with minimal business impact, and data integrity is not considered mission-critical.
Examples: Internal reporting systems that don't affect immediate business outcomes or data used for testing and development.
Moderate Dependency
Justification:

Systems or technologies under Moderate Dependency are important but not essential for core business processes. Their performance and availability are still vital for smooth business operations, though temporary disruptions might be tolerated without causing severe damage or delays.
The impact of a disruption would result in a moderate business impact, causing some inconvenience, but not halting business operations entirely.
Migration or integration efforts should aim for minimal disruption, but can still allow for scheduled downtime with adequate planning and communication.
Examples: Non-critical business applications, internal communication systems, or databases supporting reporting or analytics used intermittently.
High Dependency
Justification:

Systems classified as High Dependency are vital to business operations. Any disruption in these systems would result in significant disruption to business processes, causing delays, financial loss, or damage to the organization's reputation.
These systems support critical operational workflows, customer-facing applications, or large-scale data processes, where performance is crucial.
Migration or system changes need to be carefully planned to ensure minimal downtime, as any significant interruption can cause adverse business effects. High availability and seamless integration should be prioritized during the migration.
Examples: Core financial systems, customer transaction databases, production environments, or any system with direct customer or business impact.
Critical Dependency
Justification:

Critical Dependency systems are mission-critical, where the entire business could be at risk if the system goes down. These systems cannot afford any downtime or data loss, and failure would have severe consequences on business continuity and performance.
These systems support essential, high-priority functions such as real-time customer services, operational decision-making, or compliance-related processes.
Migration of these systems must prioritize zero downtime, full disaster recovery, and real-time failover capabilities. Additionally, testing, redundancy, and risk mitigation strategies are imperative to avoid catastrophic failure.
Examples: Real-time inventory management, order processing systems, compliance and regulatory systems, or core customer-facing platforms.
-----------------------------
Low Dependency
Justification:

Operational Importance: Systems and technologies under Low Dependency are non-essential for the day-to-day operations of the organization. They are typically auxiliary or supplementary, providing support for activities that do not directly impact core business functions or critical decision-making.
Business Impact: These systems can afford some level of downtime or disruption without causing significant delays or operational impact. If affected, the disruption is generally short-term and manageable, with little to no impact on customers or core business services.
Migration Flexibility: Given their lower importance, migration of these systems can be handled with a higher degree of flexibility. Downtime can be planned for non-peak hours or during low-impact periods, and the migration schedule can be adjusted without major risks. Testing and validation efforts are more relaxed, though basic integrity checks should still be performed.
Examples:
Internal tools for administrative tasks or non-critical reporting.
Systems used for internal documentation, knowledge management, or non-time-sensitive research.
Testing and staging environments that do not host live data or crucial business workflows.
Risk Consideration: A temporary disruption in these systems may be acceptable, but it’s still important to ensure basic recovery processes are in place to restore them quickly in the event of an issue.

Moderate Dependency
Justification:

Operational Importance: Systems categorized as Moderate Dependency are necessary for efficient business operations, but they do not have an immediate or critical impact on business outcomes. These systems support important but non-mission-critical functions that could be temporarily disrupted without severely affecting the organization’s overall performance.
Business Impact: A disruption in a Moderate Dependency system would cause inconvenience, delays, or minor financial impact but would not halt the core operations of the business. The organization could likely work around the disruption for a limited period, though there would be a noticeable decline in efficiency.
Migration Flexibility: Migration or integration of these systems requires planning to minimize downtime, but these systems are more forgiving when it comes to service interruptions. During migration, business continuity can be maintained with adequate communication and coordination, but downtime should be avoided during key business periods.
Examples:
Reporting systems that provide business intelligence but are not critical to immediate decision-making.
HR management tools, internal communication platforms, or employee productivity tools that are important for internal operations but not business-critical.
Backup systems or secondary databases that support business processes but do not handle real-time customer transactions.
Risk Consideration: A moderate disruption could impact productivity or cause inefficiencies, but the system can typically be restored without major business damage. Recovery efforts should focus on minimizing operational delays.

High Dependency
Justification:

Operational Importance: High Dependency systems are central to the organization’s core functions, supporting critical workflows or high-priority processes that directly contribute to business success. A disruption in these systems could result in significant operational slowdowns, affecting both internal performance and potentially customer-facing services.
Business Impact: Any downtime or performance issues in these systems would cause significant business disruption, possibly resulting in lost revenue, reduced customer satisfaction, or operational delays. These systems are crucial for meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) and maintaining consistent productivity.
Migration Flexibility: Migration of High Dependency systems requires a carefully planned approach, with a focus on minimizing downtime and ensuring that there is a robust plan for business continuity. Staging environments, thorough testing, and gradual migration with fallbacks should be utilized to ensure minimal impact. These systems may require live failover strategies to ensure that business operations continue even if temporary downtime occurs during migration.
Examples:
Financial systems supporting transactions, invoicing, and accounting operations that directly impact revenue generation and compliance.
Customer relationship management (CRM) platforms that support client-facing operations, including sales and service interactions.
Data integration platforms or middleware connecting business-critical applications that enable seamless information flow across the organization.
Risk Consideration: A high dependency system requires detailed risk mitigation strategies, including high availability, redundancy, disaster recovery procedures, and real-time backup. Prolonged downtime or poor migration could lead to substantial operational losses and customer dissatisfaction.

Critical Dependency
Justification:

Operational Importance: Critical Dependency systems are essential to the very functioning of the organization. These systems support mission-critical business processes, often with direct or real-time impact on customers, compliance, and overall business continuity. A failure or disruption in these systems would put the entire organization at risk, causing catastrophic impacts such as operational halts, severe revenue loss, legal penalties, or irreparable damage to the organization’s reputation.
Business Impact: Disruptions to Critical Dependency systems can result in catastrophic consequences, such as total service outages, financial crises, customer churn, or non-compliance with regulations. These systems are tightly integrated into the operational backbone of the business and cannot afford any downtime or data loss. Every part of the business depends on these systems to function correctly.
Migration Flexibility: Migration of Critical Dependency systems requires the highest level of planning and preparation. Zero downtime is a must, and any changes should only occur during low-impact windows or in parallel with failover systems to ensure business continuity. Migration should be non-intrusive, transparent, and ideally done in stages to reduce risk. Additionally, comprehensive testing and validation (preferably in production-like environments) should be carried out before any system-wide cutover.
Examples:
Core production systems that directly support customer-facing services, such as e-commerce platforms, payment processing systems, or live customer support tools.
Mission-critical applications related to regulatory compliance, such as systems handling legal documentation, financial reporting, or healthcare-related patient information.
Real-time supply chain management or inventory control systems that are essential for business operations and customer delivery.
Risk Consideration: Critical Dependency systems require highly sophisticated disaster recovery plans, real-time monitoring, and fault-tolerant architectures. The migration must be executed with the utmost caution to ensure there is no interruption in service, data loss, or breach of compliance.

====================================================================================================================================================================================
"deviation from divisional target state architecture

1. Low Deviation
Justification:
The migration process is largely in line with the divisional target state architecture. Minor adjustments have been made to fit specific requirements, but the core principles and practices are adhered to. The migration of the tables into Snowflake and their integration with the cloud follows standard guidelines, ensuring consistency and alignment with the target architecture.

Examples of low deviation:

The migration process uses tools and frameworks that align with the divisional technology stack.
Data models in Snowflake closely follow the architecture guidelines.
The integration strategy leverages cloud-native solutions with minimal customization.
2. Moderate Deviation
Justification:
The migration process partially deviates from the divisional target state architecture, but the impact is controlled. Some elements require non-standard solutions or configurations to meet specific needs, but they do not significantly undermine the overall integrity of the target architecture. These deviations are likely to have manageable long-term effects, and mitigating strategies are in place.

Examples of moderate deviation:

Minor customizations to Snowflake schema or ETL processes that deviate from the preferred architecture.
Use of cloud-specific services or technologies that aren't fully aligned with the divisional strategy but are necessary for specific functionality (e.g., using third-party tools for data migration).
Delayed migration process or dual-access tables requiring temporary workarounds that impact future integration.
3. High Deviation
Justification:
The migration process significantly deviates from the divisional target state architecture, potentially creating challenges in scalability, performance, or long-term maintenance. There is a considerable use of non-standard technologies, custom solutions, or architectural patterns that may not be fully supported by the divisional framework. These deviations pose potential risks to data consistency, integration, or operational stability.

Examples of high deviation:

The decision to keep certain tables as local copies and not fully migrate them to Snowflake, introducing potential data silos.
Use of non-standard tools or services for parts of the migration process that require additional management overhead or technical debt.
Adapting the database schema in Snowflake in a way that conflicts with divisional data governance policies.
Major performance or security concerns arise due to deviation from divisional architectural best practices.
4. Critical Deviation
Justification:
The migration process is critically misaligned with the divisional target state architecture. This misalignment results in substantial risk to the organization’s ability to achieve the long-term vision of a unified, scalable, and efficient data architecture. The architecture could be compromised in terms of security, scalability, or performance, and there are significant challenges in reconciling the migration with the target state. Immediate remediation and re-architecture may be required to avoid severe consequences.

Examples of critical deviation:

Core database components or migration processes that are fundamentally incompatible with Snowflake or cloud-native principles.
Major disruptions to data integration or inconsistent data access across cloud and local copies that compromise decision-making.
Non-compliance with divisional security or compliance standards, potentially putting sensitive data at risk.
Significant impact on system performance, leading to slow data access or system instability that threatens ongoing operations.
----------------------------------
1. Low Deviation
Justification:
The migration process is well-aligned with the divisional target state architecture, with only minimal deviations from the established guidelines. These deviations are considered necessary for specific business or technical requirements but do not affect the overall integrity or effectiveness of the architecture. The solution is designed with a focus on maintaining scalability, performance, security, and integration, and the use of standard tools and practices keeps the project within the defined architectural principles.

Examples of Low Deviation:

Architecture Compliance: The migration strategy leverages divisional standards for cloud architecture, ensuring the use of Snowflake for data warehousing, and all core components (ETL pipelines, schema design, and integration points) are built using the divisional preferred tools and methodologies.
Minimal Customization: Some minor adjustments to Snowflake schema design may have been made for specific project requirements (e.g., adding custom data types or optimizing for query performance), but these changes remain within the boundaries of divisional guidelines.
Cloud-Native Tools: The tools selected for the migration (e.g., Snowflake for data storage, AWS or Azure services for orchestration, etc.) align with divisional cloud strategies, and the migration process uses common workflows and best practices to ensure smooth operation.
Data Consistency and Syncing: The tables and data being migrated to Snowflake follow the same data models as the divisional target state, ensuring consistency in data governance and access. Any temporary local copies of data are easily managed without impacting the overall architecture.
2. Moderate Deviation
Justification:
While the core migration process is largely in line with the divisional target state architecture, certain areas require non-standard approaches or customizations that introduce slight deviations. These changes may be necessary to meet specific business or technical needs, but they still conform to overarching architectural principles. The deviations are unlikely to cause long-term problems but may introduce some operational complexity or require additional maintenance overhead in the future. A clear roadmap for mitigating these deviations is in place.

Examples of Moderate Deviation:

Custom Solutions: Certain parts of the migration or integration process have required the use of non-standard or third-party tools, either for data transformation, real-time data integration, or performance tuning. While the tools may not be part of the divisional standard stack, they provide a viable solution to meet specific performance or business needs.
Non-Standard Workflows: In order to handle specific data migration challenges (such as large volumes of data), custom workflows or manual intervention may have been incorporated into the migration process. This adds complexity and may create additional dependencies that are not fully aligned with the divisional architecture.
Temporary Data Structures: Some data tables or datasets are being kept as local copies in parallel with Snowflake as part of a phased migration approach. While this does not fully align with the target architecture’s emphasis on cloud-native solutions, it is considered a transitional measure. However, this dual-state could introduce potential challenges in terms of data consistency, latency, and integration complexity.
Security and Compliance Adjustments: Minor deviations from divisional security policies may be necessary in cases where certain data sets need to be treated differently or if specialized access controls are required. These exceptions are carefully monitored to ensure compliance over time.
3. High Deviation
Justification:
The migration process shows a significant deviation from the divisional target state architecture, affecting key aspects of scalability, performance, integration, or compliance. The use of non-standard technologies or methodologies has created a gap between the current implementation and the divisional architecture. While still operational, these deviations may result in increased risks around data consistency, long-term maintainability, or operational efficiency. The high deviation level suggests that corrective actions may be required in the medium term to ensure full alignment.

Examples of High Deviation:

Non-Standard Technologies: The migration utilizes technologies, platforms, or services that are outside of the divisional preferred stack, such as custom-built data integration tools or third-party cloud services that are not fully integrated into the organization’s architecture. These technologies may introduce risk due to limited support, complexity, or potential incompatibility with future updates.
Complex Integration Patterns: The migration introduces complex integration patterns between Snowflake and on-premises systems, requiring the creation of non-standard connectors, APIs, or custom synchronization processes. This increases operational complexity and may reduce the overall performance and reliability of the system, as custom code could introduce bugs or scalability issues.
Data Synchronization Issues: The dual-maintenance of some data in local copies outside of Snowflake could create challenges in ensuring consistent data across all systems. If data discrepancies occur between the local copies and the cloud-based Snowflake tables, this could lead to operational confusion and errors, impacting data integrity and analysis.
Inconsistent Schema Design: Some elements of the Snowflake schema design deviate from the divisional data model standards, either due to business-specific requirements or technical constraints. These deviations may affect reporting consistency, create additional complexity in data pipelines, or cause issues with data governance and auditability.
Performance or Scalability Risks: There may be concerns about the long-term performance or scalability of the solution, particularly if the non-standard approaches to migration result in bottlenecks, unoptimized queries, or inefficiencies in data processing.
4. Critical Deviation
Justification:
The migration process is critically misaligned with the divisional target state architecture, with significant and potentially harmful consequences. These deviations create substantial risks to system performance, data integrity, scalability, security, or compliance. The architecture’s foundations have been compromised, and immediate remediation is necessary to align with divisional objectives and ensure the long-term sustainability of the solution. This level of deviation may require a full re-architecture or a drastic change in the migration approach to avoid severe operational disruptions or security concerns.

Examples of Critical Deviation:

Incompatible Technologies or Platforms: The migration process uses technologies or platforms that are fundamentally incompatible with the divisional target architecture. This may include using an incompatible database solution, non-cloud-native technologies, or third-party services that cannot be integrated into the divisional cloud strategy. The use of these technologies severely hampers integration and operational efficiency.
Data Integrity and Availability Issues: Data being migrated to Snowflake is not consistently synchronized with the source or local copies, resulting in major issues with data integrity. This could include large-scale data loss, corruption, or discrepancies that impact business operations and decision-making. The critical deviation may also involve broken or unreliable data pipelines, rendering the migrated data unusable.
Non-Compliance with Security or Governance Standards: The migration approach introduces significant security risks, such as inadequate data encryption, unauthorized access, or breaches of compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). These risks can expose the organization to legal and financial penalties and threaten the protection of sensitive data.
Severe Performance Bottlenecks: The migration strategy introduces major performance issues, such as slow query processing in Snowflake, data latency due to poor integration, or inefficient data storage. These bottlenecks disrupt daily operations, impact business analytics, and prevent the system from scaling as needed.
Operational Instability: Critical aspects of the migration, such as data replication, schema design, or user access controls, are not aligned with the divisional architecture, resulting in operational instability. This could include system outages, prolonged downtime, or ongoing failures in integration processes, which negatively affect business continuity and operational efficiency.

deviation from divisional target state architecture

Low Deviation
Justification: The migration process is generally aligned with the divisional target architecture but involves minor, acceptable variances due to practical constraints. For example, certain tables are moved in phases, and while they’re initially available as local copies in the cloud, they will eventually be integrated into Snowflake. These adjustments do not significantly impact performance, scalability, or the long-term architecture, and are being addressed in future iterations.
Examples:
Some minor adjustments in migration timelines.
Temporary use of local copies in the cloud that do not cause major performance bottlenecks.
Minimal schema changes not affecting the overall architecture.
Moderate Deviation
Justification: While the overall direction of the migration is aligned with the divisional target architecture, the phased approach introduces some challenges. The delay in full migration of certain tables might introduce potential risks in data consistency and real-time synchronization, but these can be mitigated with careful monitoring and optimization. There might be additional resource allocation or adjustments needed, but it doesn’t fundamentally disrupt the architecture’s core structure.
Examples:
Some tables remain as local copies longer than anticipated, potentially leading to performance overhead.
Temporary architectural decisions (such as syncing between local copies and Snowflake) that might not be fully optimized.
Additional infrastructure or tools being used to support phased migrations, deviating slightly from the target design.

High Deviation
Justification: The current migration approach significantly diverges from the divisional target architecture, impacting both system performance and long-term scalability. The use of local copies in the cloud introduces complexity in managing data consistency, and there might be challenges in ensuring that data across different systems remains synchronized effectively. These deviations require immediate attention to avoid potential system instability or alignment issues with the divisional strategy.
Examples:
Performance degradation due to suboptimal syncing between local copies and Snowflake.
Architectural complexity that adds unnecessary overhead or operational risk.
Delayed or suboptimal migration plan causing disruptions in overall data flow or business operations.
Critical Deviation
Justification: The migration approach is severely misaligned with the divisional target architecture, threatening the integrity, performance, and scalability of the entire system. The prolonged use of local copies and delays in migration could lead to significant data integrity issues, sync failures, and operational disruptions. Immediate corrective action is needed to realign with the divisional strategy and avoid catastrophic failure or long-term inefficiencies.
Examples:
Critical data consistency issues caused by unsynchronized local copies and Snowflake.
Major architectural shifts required due to the migration approach, leading to significant delays or system outages.
Severe operational risk due to lack of clear alignment with the target architecture and strategic goals.
---------------------------
Low Deviation
Justification: The current approach to database migration and integration, while slightly deviating from the divisional target state architecture, is deemed acceptable due to the phased migration strategy. Minor variances include temporary measures such as the use of local copies of tables in the cloud, which will eventually be integrated into Snowflake. These deviations do not present significant risk to overall system performance, scalability, or strategic objectives. The architectural principles remain intact, and the deviations are expected to be addressed in future phases without significant long-term impact.
Examples:
The phased migration schedule is slightly delayed but does not pose risks to system performance or data integrity.
Temporary usage of local copies of data tables, which do not impact the overall architecture or introduce significant latency.
Minor schema changes or adjustments that don't impact the broader design, such as temporary workarounds to maintain data flow.
Small deviations in technology stack that are acceptable and won’t affect the divisional target state in the long run.
Temporary solutions for interoperability between migrated and non-migrated tables that align with best practices and can be refined post-migration.
Moderate Deviation
Justification: The phased migration strategy introduces noticeable but manageable deviations from the divisional target state architecture. While the system remains functional, there are challenges related to the management of data consistency, synchronization, and performance, which may become more pronounced as the system scales. The architecture is deviating in some areas, especially with the prolonged use of local copies of tables in the cloud. These challenges require adjustments, resource allocation, and possibly new tools or processes to bring the architecture back in line with the target state. Though they don’t pose an immediate risk, these deviations should be addressed within a reasonable timeframe to ensure long-term alignment with the divisional strategy.
Examples:
The extended use of local copies of data introduces some challenges in terms of performance and consistency, leading to a potential lag in real-time data updates.
Data synchronization and integration tools are required to handle differences between local copies and Snowflake, adding complexity to the system.
Increased resource allocation (e.g., cloud storage or compute power) to support the phased migration approach, slightly deviating from the target architecture.
Certain architectural decisions that temporarily diverge from the divisional strategy, such as the reliance on manual syncing methods or non-ideal cloud infrastructure solutions.
Temporary modifications to the database schema or design patterns that don’t fully adhere to divisional standards but do not introduce major risk.
High Deviation
Justification: The migration process is facing significant deviation from the divisional target state architecture, and these issues need to be addressed to avoid compromising the system’s performance, scalability, and alignment with strategic goals. The use of local copies for extended periods is leading to increased complexity in data consistency management, real-time syncing, and operational overhead. The increased resource demand for handling inconsistent data across systems and the challenges introduced by mismatched architectures require immediate remediation. At this level, corrective actions should be taken promptly to prevent performance degradation, unnecessary risk, and misalignment with the long-term goals of the organization.
Examples:
Data consistency issues are becoming more frequent, with synchronization delays and discrepancies between local copies and Snowflake, affecting the reliability of data.
The need for additional tools or custom-built solutions to manage complex synchronization between local and cloud-based tables, causing increased operational costs and resource usage.
Significant performance degradation during peak workloads due to suboptimal architecture or integration processes, making it harder to meet business demands and service level agreements (SLAs).
Prolonged use of non-target architecture, such as maintaining local copies of tables in the cloud indefinitely, instead of fully integrating them into Snowflake, potentially introducing more points of failure.
Increased operational risks and manual intervention due to a lack of automation in the syncing process, leading to inefficiencies in data flow and potential service interruptions.
Critical Deviation
Justification: The current state of the database migration represents a severe deviation from the divisional target state architecture, posing immediate risks to the stability, performance, and security of the entire system. The use of local copies, delays in full migration to Snowflake, and the resulting data inconsistency are significantly hindering the efficiency of the architecture. These critical issues have the potential to disrupt business operations, compromise data integrity, and result in significant operational risks. Immediate action is required to realign the architecture with the divisional target state to prevent potential system outages, data breaches, or long-term inefficiencies. This situation demands urgent corrective action, which may involve revisiting the migration strategy, reconsidering architectural decisions, and potentially overhauling the cloud infrastructure to ensure alignment with organizational goals.
Examples:
Data Integrity Risk: Persistent synchronization failures or discrepancies between local copies and Snowflake are causing data corruption or unreliable reporting. This compromises the trust in the data across the organization and risks business-critical decisions being made on faulty information.
Performance and Availability Issues: Major performance issues are arising from the lack of full integration between cloud-based and local copies of tables, severely impacting system responsiveness and availability during peak usage, leading to downtime or degraded user experience.
Severe Architecture Misalignment: The architectural decisions made for the migration process (e.g., continued use of local copies, non-standard cloud configurations) are causing the system to diverge too far from the divisional target, making it difficult to integrate new technologies or meet scalability demands as the business grows.
Operational Disruptions: Increased reliance on manual processes to sync data or maintain local copies is leading to a high degree of manual intervention, frequent errors, and unexpected outages, impacting business continuity.
Security and Compliance Risks: Potential security vulnerabilities arise due to inconsistent data storage methods, creating challenges with data governance, privacy regulations, and compliance audits, especially if data across environments is not properly secured or synchronized.
