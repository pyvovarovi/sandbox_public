Justification for Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy

Low Deviation Justification:

The solution aligns with the divisional technology strategy, leveraging Snowflake as the central cloud data platform.
Any deviations are minor and temporary, with a clear plan for resolution (e.g., phased migration of remaining tables).
Follows best practices for cloud adoption, data integration, and security.
No long-term impact on architectural consistency or target state compliance.

Moderate Deviation Justification:

The majority of the solution follows the divisional technology strategy, but some exceptions exist.
Temporary local copies of certain tables are maintained in the cloud before full migration to Snowflake.
Some non-standard integration processes are required, though they do not introduce significant operational risks.
A roadmap exists to bring the solution fully into compliance, though it may take additional time or resources.

High Deviation Justification:

The project introduces non-strategic components or dependencies that are not aligned with the divisional technology roadmap.
Local copies or hybrid database solutions are retained long-term, increasing operational complexity.
The approach creates fragmentation in data access, governance, or security models.
Additional investments are required to align with divisional strategy, but no immediate resolution is in place.

Critical Deviation Justification:

The project fundamentally contradicts the divisional technology strategy.
Key architectural principles, such as cloud-first adoption and Snowflake standardization, are not followed.
Legacy or proprietary solutions are retained, preventing seamless cloud integration.
No clear plan exists to mitigate the deviation, posing long-term risks to scalability, cost efficiency, and governance.
