Economic impact, internal technology investment

1. Low
Economic Impact: Minimal cost implications; the project has little to no effect on operational budgets.
Internal Technology Investment: Uses existing tools and infrastructure with no significant additional investment.
Justification:
Leverages open-source or already licensed technologies.
Minor impact on ongoing operations or revenue streams.
No significant infrastructure, licensing, or personnel costs.
2. Moderate
Economic Impact: Noticeable but manageable costs; potential for moderate efficiency gains or operational savings.
Internal Technology Investment: Requires some additional technology investments (e.g., minor cloud storage costs, middleware, or automation tools).
Justification:
Improves operational efficiency and data management.
Requires investment in cloud storage, APIs, or minor tooling.
Some level of staff training or reallocation of resources is needed.
3. High
Economic Impact: Significant financial implications; either through high upfront investment or potential cost savings.
Internal Technology Investment: Requires purchasing/licensing new tools, substantial cloud infrastructure, or dedicated team efforts.
Justification:
Large-scale data migration with high processing/storage costs.
Requires dedicated cloud services (e.g., Snowflake compute costs).
May need third-party integration, ETL pipelines, or managed services.
4. Critical
Economic Impact: Business-critical financial implications; failure or success has a direct effect on revenue, regulatory compliance, or competitive advantage.
Internal Technology Investment: Requires a major, long-term strategic investment in cloud infrastructure, data platforms, and skilled personnel.
Justification:
Essential for regulatory compliance or business continuity.
Involves large-scale restructuring of data architecture.
High compute, storage, and data processing costs with ongoing maintenance.
Direct impact on business revenue, customer experience, or risk management.
