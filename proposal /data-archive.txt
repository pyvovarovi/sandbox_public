====================================================================================================================================================================
deviation from divisional target state architecture

Justification for Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture
1. Low Deviation
Definition: Minor misalignment with target architecture, but does not impact long-term strategic goals.

Justification:

Temporary workaround required due to an ongoing migration or integration phase.
A non-critical system component requires custom implementation due to vendor constraints.
A short-term deviation necessary to maintain business continuity while transitioning to target architecture.
The cost of immediate compliance outweighs the benefits, but alignment is planned.
2. Moderate Deviation
Definition: Noticeable misalignment that introduces some risk but is manageable in the medium term.

Justification:

Dependencies on legacy systems that cannot be decommissioned immediately.
The required technology or architecture standard is not fully supported by a critical third-party vendor.
Performance or scalability requirements necessitate temporary use of non-standard architecture.
Budgetary or resource constraints prevent full compliance at this stage.
The deviation is intentional to enable innovation, but a roadmap exists for alignment.
3. High Deviation
Definition: Significant misalignment that poses considerable risk to architecture goals and requires mitigation.

Justification:

Critical business operations rely on a system that cannot be migrated without major disruption.
Enterprise-wide architecture standards conflict with regulatory or compliance obligations.
The current architecture does not support required functionality, and an alternative solution must be used.
Major cost implications prevent immediate alignment, and a phased approach is required.
Organizational restructuring or acquisitions have led to temporary divergence from standards.
4. Critical Deviation
Definition: Fundamental misalignment that threatens the stability, security, or compliance of the IT landscape.

Justification:

Compliance with regulatory frameworks mandates an alternative approach that contradicts divisional target architecture.
The standard architecture does not support mission-critical requirements, necessitating an exceptional approach.
An urgent security vulnerability requires immediate deviation to prevent data breaches or operational shutdowns.
An unavoidable dependency on a proprietary or external system prevents adherence to architectural standards.
Business survival depends on a unique implementation that conflicts with standard architecture guidelines.

"deviation from divisional technology strategy"

1. Low Deviation:
Justification:

Minimal Impact on the overall strategy, with only small adjustments required.
The technology choice does not fully align with divisional standards but does not introduce significant risks or inefficiencies.
The MongoDB-to-Snowflake approach adheres to key divisional technology guidelines, but with slight variations that can be justified due to business requirements, such as optimizing data transfer speed or leveraging existing integrations that are already in place.
The change can be addressed with minor updates to infrastructure, minimal additional training, and can be controlled without disrupting ongoing operations.
2. Moderate Deviation:
Justification:

Noticeable impact on the overall strategy, but still manageable within the existing framework.
A clear rationale exists for why the chosen solution does not align fully with divisional standards (e.g., performance optimization, specific compliance or security requirements).
The MongoDB-to-Snowflake solution may require a specialized integration that does not follow divisional guidelines for cloud migrations or API usage, but it provides significant performance or cost benefits.
Some additional effort may be needed to integrate this new solution with existing technologies, requiring updates to existing policies or infrastructure.
3. High Deviation:
Justification:

Significant impact on the divisional technology strategy and may introduce challenges in maintaining long-term alignment.
The technology choice may introduce complexities that require major changes in infrastructure, ongoing support, or workflows.
In the case of MongoDB-to-Snowflake, a non-standard approach to data handling (such as bypassing the standard data transfer protocols or using a customized API solution) might introduce operational challenges, such as inconsistent data formats or dependencies on unsupported technologies.
This deviation could require specialized skills and increase the effort required for support, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
4. Critical Deviation:
Justification:

Severe impact on divisional technology strategy, leading to significant risks or resource overhead.
The chosen technology diverges so much from divisional standards that it may lead to strategic misalignment, security concerns, operational inefficiencies, or even potential compliance violations.
For example, a MongoDB-to-Snowflake approach that requires completely custom-built integration components without leveraging divisional cloud storage policies, security practices, or monitoring tools would create serious risks.
There may be substantial risks to data integrity, security, or performance. The resources required for implementing and maintaining such a deviation would exceed the benefits, making it unsustainable in the long term.

"deviation from divisional architecture principles"

1. Low Deviation
Justification:

The architecture design closely follows divisional principles, requiring minimal changes.
Snowflake's support for JSON (via VARIANT) and its native API integration with cloud storage aligns with established best practices.
Only slight customizations may be needed to accommodate specific data formats from MongoDB, which don’t compromise scalability, maintainability, or security.
Example: Using Snowflake's COPY INTO for batch loading and ensuring proper transformation of data from MongoDB to a supported JSON format. This solution is in line with cloud-first principles.
2. Moderate Deviation
Justification:

The implementation involves some custom components or non-standard tools, which are outside the typical technology stack but still provide a functional solution.
Although most of the solution utilizes Snowflake’s features (APIs, VARIANT data type), some custom scripts (e.g., for data transformation or orchestration) or third-party tools may be required for seamless integration between MongoDB and Snowflake.
Example: Introducing a third-party ETL tool or developing custom Python scripts to handle incremental updates between MongoDB and Snowflake might slightly deviate from divisional standards but still delivers a functional solution. It may introduce additional overhead or maintenance complexity.
3. High Deviation
Justification:

A significant portion of the architecture involves non-standard components or approaches, which deviate from divisional architecture principles.
This might involve using non-recommended data formats, relying on unsupported or custom APIs, or creating complex and bespoke integrations between MongoDB and Snowflake that risk long-term maintainability and scalability.
Example: Storing data in a non-compliant storage format, using external services (e.g., MongoDB Atlas or other cloud-managed services) that aren’t aligned with divisional standards, or creating a non-standard data pipeline without proper integration with existing infrastructure tools.
