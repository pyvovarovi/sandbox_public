Economic impact, internal technology investment

Economic Impact
1. Low
Reusing Framework:
The framework is lightweight, has low licensing fees (if applicable), and requires minimal additional infrastructure investment.
No major integration challenges, so it can be quickly adapted to current needs without causing financial strain.
Ongoing costs are low, and any potential overhead from using the framework doesn't outweigh its benefits.
Building Custom Utility:
Custom utility is built using existing in-house tools and technologies, minimizing costs.
Minimal development time, leading to lower upfront cost compared to a larger project or framework.
No dependency on external services or licenses, thus limiting external costs and keeping economic impact low.
2. Moderate
Reusing Framework:

The framework might have moderate licensing fees, setup costs, or ongoing operational costs.
Customization and integration with existing systems might require moderate time and effort, but the framework is largely ready to use with minimal adjustments.
The framework provides a good balance of functionality versus cost, making it a reasonable choice without large economic strain.
Building Custom Utility:

Initial development is moderate in scope and cost, requiring time for design, development, and testing.
Use of internal resources to build and maintain the solution introduces moderate internal investment.
You may face unforeseen challenges, such as additional data movement complexities, requiring more resources than initially estimated.
3. High
Reusing Framework:

The framework requires substantial upfront investment, either in licensing fees or hardware infrastructure.
Integrating the framework into your environment involves high internal resource costs, including system architecture changes and specialized staff for deployment and maintenance.
Potential ongoing costs for support, training, or additional functionality increase the total economic impact significantly.
Building Custom Utility:

Building a custom utility requires a higher internal investment due to longer development time and more extensive resources.
The complexity of the integration might increase costs significantly, particularly if there are future scaling needs or evolving requirements that necessitate more work.
You may need to invest in external technologies, services, or APIs that result in higher upfront costs.
4. Critical
Reusing Framework:

The framework imposes a critical economic impact if the licensing or operational costs are unsustainable long-term, or if additional infrastructure is needed to support its scale.
The complexity of the framework and the internal investment required for customization and maintenance could lead to critical financial constraints.
There may be high costs related to failure or system downtime if the framework requires specialized knowledge or complex integration that your team is unprepared for.
Building Custom Utility:

Developing the custom solution may result in a critical economic impact due to unforeseen complexities or the need for significant resources over time.
If the utility requires constant iteration or scaling, it may stretch internal resources and result in financial overextension.
The cost of maintaining and scaling the solution internally could exceed initial projections, leading to critical financial strain.
Internal Technology Investment
1. Low
Reusing Framework:
Minimal internal technology investment needed. The framework is relatively easy to integrate with existing systems and does not require extensive internal resources for deployment.
Maintenance overhead is low, and the framework can be managed by current staff without the need for specialized roles or training.
Building Custom Utility:
The development effort is small and based on existing internal tools, so the technology investment required is minimal.
The utility can be created by leveraging existing skills and tools without requiring new hires or additional technology stack investments.
2. Moderate
Reusing Framework:

The framework may require some internal investment in training or specialized resources to configure and use effectively.
You might need to allocate internal teams for ongoing monitoring, troubleshooting, or maintaining the integration, which could introduce moderate internal technology costs.
There may be additional investment needed for optimization, scaling, or customization to fully align the framework with business needs.
Building Custom Utility:

Development and implementation require a moderate internal technology investment in terms of both resources and time.
The utility may require some infrastructure changes, integration with APIs, or backend updates, which leads to moderate internal investment.
You may need to invest in ensuring long-term support, which requires internal resources for ongoing testing, debugging, and feature updates.
3. High
Reusing Framework:

The framework requires significant internal technology investment for integration, customization, and ongoing support.
It may require dedicated teams for both deployment and continuous management, including monitoring, scaling, and troubleshooting.
Long-term investment will be needed to keep the system running optimally, especially if the framework is feature-rich and needs specialized skill sets for maintenance.
Building Custom Utility:

A custom solution will require high internal technology investment in terms of development, integration, and optimization.
You may need to invest in new infrastructure or tools, especially for scaling and performance optimization.
Continuous development and enhancements to the custom utility will require sustained investment from your internal teams, making it a high investment over time.
4. Critical
Reusing Framework:

The internal technology investment becomes critical if the integration of the framework requires specialized technology, significant re-architecture, or custom modifications that are beyond the initial scope.
There might be a critical shortage of internal expertise or resources to manage the framework long-term, resulting in dependency on expensive external consultants or training programs.
The complexity of managing and scaling the framework over time could require a disproportionate allocation of internal resources, disrupting other initiatives.
Building Custom Utility:

The technology investment becomes critical if the custom utility requires significant and ongoing internal resources for maintenance, scaling, and feature updates.
There might be a constant drain on resources as the utility evolves, potentially pulling internal teams away from other strategic projects.
If the utility requires specialized infrastructure, tools, or ongoing technical debt management, the internal technology investment could exceed what was originally anticipated.
