IT technology dependancy

1. Low Dependency
Justification:

Minimal Impact on Operations: Technology in this category does not significantly affect business operations. If it fails, it has a minimal to no impact on the overall functioning of the organization.
Flexibility in Alternatives: These systems or tools are either rarely used or have easy manual workarounds or backup solutions in place. Therefore, there is no urgent need for high levels of resource investment or advanced protection measures.
Cost Efficiency Focus: The business impact of failure is limited, so resources are best allocated to other critical systems. Investments in redundancy, high availability, or performance tuning are generally not a priority for this category.
Risk Tolerance: A higher level of risk tolerance is acceptable since the consequences of failure are not business-threatening. Downtime or performance degradation will not create significant operational disruption.
2. Moderate Dependency
Justification:

Supportive Role in Operations: Technology in this category supports important business functions but is not essential for immediate operations. However, prolonged downtime or poor performance could impact productivity or efficiency.
Business Efficiency: While not critical, these systems enhance business processes and contribute to overall productivity. Their failure can result in inefficiencies, but alternatives are often available.
Risk Mitigation Strategies Needed: While not business-critical, some level of risk mitigation is still necessary. Recovery time objectives (RTO) should be planned and systems should have basic monitoring, but the need for high availability is not as urgent.
Resource Allocation: Investment in these systems should prioritize reliability and usability but with a balanced approach to resource allocation. Customization or a simple framework might be sufficient.
3. High Dependency
Justification:

Integral to Daily Operations: This technology is essential to key business processes, and failure can have a direct and significant impact on operations. Disruptions can lead to a loss of productivity, reduced service quality, or even revenue loss.
Impact on Customer Satisfaction and Revenue: Systems in this category are often directly linked to customer-facing applications or internal operations that have direct financial impacts. Downtime or performance issues may result in customer dissatisfaction or operational delays.
Critical for Competitive Advantage: High-dependency technologies are often used to maintain a competitive edge by improving efficiency, data processing, or customer experience. Their failure can hinder the organization's ability to compete in the market.
Strong Risk Mitigation Required: Strong disaster recovery plans, backup solutions, and performance monitoring are critical to minimize business interruptions. Systems in this category should have built-in redundancy, failover capabilities, and proactive monitoring to prevent issues.
4. Critical Dependency
Justification:

Core to Business Continuity: These technologies are absolutely essential for the functioning of the business. Any failure could cause severe disruption, financial loss, or even operational paralysis. These systems are mission-critical and, in some cases, irreplaceable.
Direct Impact on Revenue, Security, or Compliance: These systems are typically tied to core business processes such as financial transactions, customer data management, regulatory compliance, or other mission-critical services. A failure can directly impact revenue streams, security posture, and legal compliance.
Irreplaceable for Operations: No adequate alternative or manual workaround is available for these systems. Their failure would result in an immediate business crisis.
Zero Tolerance for Downtime: These systems must operate with high availability, redundancy, and security. Any downtime is unacceptable, and a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy must be in place with guaranteed recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).
Proactive Risk Management and Security: Investments must be made to ensure continuous operation, including high levels of monitoring, cybersecurity defenses, and scalability. Regular performance optimization and testing are mandatory, along with real-time alerts and proactive response strategies.

===============================================================================================================================================
architecture-related policy violation

1. Low Violation
Justification:
This category is reserved for minor infractions that have negligible impact on the overall architecture. These violations typically involve small deviations from established guidelines or standards that do not interfere with system stability, security, or functionality. They might be due to oversight, legacy constraints, or an area where the policy does not apply strictly due to specific project requirements.

Examples: Slight deviations in naming conventions, non-critical design inconsistencies, or missed documentation requirements.
Reasoning: These violations are considered low-priority because they do not pose a risk to the system’s performance or security. They are generally easy to resolve in routine updates or improvements without requiring urgent action.
2. Moderate Violation
Justification:
A moderate violation typically indicates a deviation that could affect the system’s performance, scalability, or security in a limited way. While these violations are not immediately harmful, they could become problematic over time if not addressed. They often arise from a gap in policy understanding, evolving requirements, or trade-offs made during the design or implementation phase.

Examples: Suboptimal use of resources, incomplete integration of new technologies, minor security loopholes that do not present immediate threats.
Reasoning: The impact of moderate violations, while not critical, could lead to inefficiencies, performance degradation, or potential vulnerabilities if left unaddressed. While not immediately urgent, these violations should be addressed as soon as possible to prevent escalation.
3. High Violation
Justification:
High violations represent significant breaches of architectural policies that can have a direct impact on the performance, scalability, or security of the system. These violations are likely to affect system reliability, increase the risk of failure, or result in the inefficient use of resources. They may stem from technical debt, insufficient adherence to guidelines, or rushed decisions during the development process.

Examples: Poorly optimized data flows, security vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches, integration issues that risk system availability, significant performance bottlenecks.
Reasoning: High violations pose substantial risks to the organization and the system. While they do not necessarily result in catastrophic failures, they require immediate remediation to prevent service degradation, security breaches, or operational inefficiencies that could affect the business.
4. Critical Violation
Justification:
Critical violations are severe breaches that represent an immediate threat to the overall architecture’s integrity, security, or functionality. These violations could lead to system outages, data breaches, or a total failure of core systems. They may arise from fundamental design flaws, misalignments with the overarching technology strategy, or non-compliance with essential security or regulatory requirements.

Examples: Major security gaps (e.g., improper data encryption or unpatched vulnerabilities), loss of data integrity, system crashes, or failure to meet compliance standards.
Reasoning: Critical violations represent the most urgent category of issues that demand immediate action to avoid catastrophic consequences. These violations could severely disrupt business operations, damage the organization’s reputation, or lead to financial loss. Addressing them swiftly is paramount to safeguarding the system and the organization's assets.

Example: Building a completely custom solution from scratch with technology or architecture choices that are not well-supported by the divisional architecture, requiring significant resources to maintain and scale.

4. Critical Deviation:
Justification:

Complete Misalignment with Strategy: The selected data movement solution fundamentally conflicts with the divisional target state architecture, leading to major gaps between the chosen solution and the organization's long-term strategic goals. This deviation may compromise core principles of the divisional architecture (e.g., modularity, scalability, security).
Strategic Risks: Adopting this solution could introduce critical risks to scalability, integration, or security, causing severe inefficiencies in the overall architecture. There could be a risk to data governance, security compliance, or performance that directly impacts the business.
Unmanageable Technical Debt: The solution introduces substantial technical debt, which will be difficult to address without a complete redesign or significant resources. The deviation could require ongoing patches or manual interventions, which are unsustainable.
Long-term Viability: This decision could jeopardize future integrations or make it more difficult to meet evolving business requirements, as the solution does not adhere to the core principles and goals of the divisional target state.
Example: Implementing a completely unsupported data movement framework or technology that has no integration path with the divisional architecture, severely impacting overall business operations and scalability.
===============================================================================================================================================
deviation from divisional technology strategy

1. Low Deviation
Justification:

The decision to use an existing data movement framework aligns with the divisional technology strategy, with minimal customization required. The framework is part of or compatible with the existing toolset, and it adheres to the divisional standards for integration, security, and scalability. There are no major changes to the current architecture, and the framework adds functionality that is largely in line with the divisional vision, ensuring continuity and stability in the architecture.
Example:

An existing data movement framework already adopted across other teams is leveraged, requiring only minor adjustments to meet specific project needs without impacting divisional strategy.

2. Moderate Deviation
Justification:

The decision introduces some degree of deviation from the divisional technology strategy. While the framework or custom solution is largely compatible with divisional standards, it may require adjustments or additional features that are outside of the current preferred stack. There may be some trade-offs made in terms of integration or compatibility with other systems, but these can be managed with additional effort. The solution remains largely within the bounds of the technology strategy, though it requires some flexibility.
Example:

Using a data movement framework that is not fully adopted by the division, but is still based on widely accepted technologies. Custom integrations or slight architectural shifts may be necessary, but the impact is manageable and aligns with broader divisional principles.

3. High Deviation
Justification:

The decision introduces significant changes to the divisional technology strategy. The custom solution or selected framework may not align well with the broader divisional architecture, leading to potential risks in integration, compatibility, or long-term scalability. While it solves an immediate problem, it may result in a more fragmented architecture or introduce challenges that will require additional resources to maintain. The deviation could disrupt the overall divisional strategy if similar decisions are made across other projects.
Example:

Building a custom data movement utility that requires significant effort to integrate with existing systems or using a framework that doesn’t adhere to divisional standards for security, scalability, or cloud-first strategies. This may create complexity in managing dependencies, ongoing updates, or long-term compatibility.

4. Critical Deviation
Justification:

The decision represents a major departure from the divisional technology strategy, potentially jeopardizing the coherence of the architecture, security, or scalability goals. The selected framework or custom solution is incompatible with key divisional principles or long-term technology direction. It may introduce significant risks to system performance, maintainability, or the ability to scale. This kind of deviation may lead to a fragmented and unsustainable technology landscape that complicates future integration, support, or growth. A critical deviation might require significant rework down the line to realign the architecture.
Example:

Building a custom data movement solution that relies on outdated, unsupported technologies or a framework that is incompatible with the divisional cloud-first strategy, security standards, or data governance policies. Such a decision could result in a fragmented architecture that is difficult to support and scale, with long-term consequences for alignment with the divisional vision.
