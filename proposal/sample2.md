deviation from divisional technology strategy.

Below is a structured, technical response that refines the scenario context, defines deviation levels, and presents 10 targeted questions—with example answers for each deviation level—to help the business owner justify and assess deviations from the divisional technology strategy.

---

## 1. Scenario Overview

**Context:**  
- The project involves migrating and integrating databases to the cloud.  
- A single migration process does not cover all tables; some will be migrated in a second process as local copies.  
- Ultimately, all tables will reside in Snowflake.  

This multi-phased approach requires clear risk and deviation assessments to ensure the cloud solution aligns with divisional technology strategy.

## 2. Deviation Levels from Divisional Technology Strategy

**Defined Levels:**  
- **Low:** Minimal deviation; migration aligns closely with established strategy.  
- **Moderate:** Noticeable gaps exist, but risks are manageable.  
- **High:** Significant deviations that could affect operations or strategic alignment.  
- **Critical:** Major divergence with severe operational, compliance, or security risks.

## 3. 10 Structured Questions with Examples

Each question is designed to probe different aspects of the migration, with example responses reflecting the four deviation levels.

### Question 1: Data Integrity & Consistency  
**Query:** “How do you ensure data integrity and consistency when some tables are migrated by different processes?”  

- **Low:** “We have implemented robust ETL routines with end-to-end reconciliation to maintain data integrity.”  
- **Moderate:** “We use automated checks, though some manual validations are required between processes.”  
- **High:** “There are intermittent mismatches; our reconciliation processes need improvements to catch cross-process inconsistencies.”  
- **Critical:** “Current checks are insufficient, leading to frequent integrity issues and discrepancies between data sets.”

---

### Question 2: Data Synchronization and Latency  
**Query:** “What are the expected synchronization delays between the primary migrated tables and local copies in Snowflake?”  

- **Low:** “Synchronization is near real time with minimal latency impacting operations.”  
- **Moderate:** “Minor delays exist, but they only slightly affect non-critical reporting.”  
- **High:** “Noticeable delays are causing operational slowdowns and affecting decision-making.”  
- **Critical:** “Synchronization delays are severe, leading to outdated data and potential compliance risks.”

---

### Question 3: System Downtime & Business Continuity  
**Query:** “How is the planned migration designed to manage downtime and ensure business continuity?”  

- **Low:** “We have scheduled downtime with full backup and rollback plans in place, ensuring minimal disruption.”  
- **Moderate:** “Downtime is limited, though some business operations might experience short service interruptions.”  
- **High:** “Extended downtime has been observed during testing, which may affect critical functions.”  
- **Critical:** “Downtime risks are high, potentially leading to major business interruptions and revenue loss.”

---

### Question 4: Compliance and Regulatory Impact  
**Query:** “How does the migration strategy address compliance and regulatory requirements?”  

- **Low:** “All regulatory controls are integrated into the migration with continuous compliance monitoring.”  
- **Moderate:** “Most compliance requirements are met; however, a few areas require additional validation.”  
- **High:** “There are multiple gaps in compliance measures that could expose us to regulatory scrutiny.”  
- **Critical:** “Non-compliance is a significant issue with several regulatory risks that have not been mitigated.”

---

### Question 5: Scalability and Future Integration  
**Query:** “How will the migration accommodate future scalability and integration with additional systems?”  

- **Low:** “The architecture is designed to scale seamlessly with well-defined integration APIs.”  
- **Moderate:** “Scalability is planned; however, integration interfaces need further refinement to support future growth.”  
- **High:** “The current plan shows limited scalability, raising concerns about future integrations.”  
- **Critical:** “There is no clear scalability strategy, which could severely constrain future integration efforts.”

---

### Question 6: Performance and Query Optimization  
**Query:** “What measures are in place to maintain optimal query performance in Snowflake, considering the phased migration?”  

- **Low:** “We’ve implemented advanced indexing, partitioning, and query optimization to sustain performance.”  
- **Moderate:** “Performance is generally good, though some queries require tuning due to mixed data sources.”  
- **High:** “Performance degradation is evident, especially when querying across differently migrated tables.”  
- **Critical:** “Performance bottlenecks are critical and are severely impacting key business operations.”

---

### Question 7: Security Posture and Data Protection  
**Query:** “What security controls and data protection measures are implemented during and after migration?”  

- **Low:** “We have comprehensive security protocols, including encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring.”  
- **Moderate:** “Security measures are largely in place, but certain areas need stronger controls during migration.”  
- **High:** “There are several vulnerabilities identified in our current security setup that need immediate attention.”  
- **Critical:** “Security risks are critical; our current measures do not sufficiently protect against potential breaches.”

---

### Question 8: Resource Allocation and Budget Alignment  
**Query:** “How does the migration plan align with our current budget and resource allocation?”  

- **Low:** “The project is well within budget with clearly allocated resources and contingency funds.”  
- **Moderate:** “There are some resource constraints, but overall the budget is sufficient with minor adjustments.”  
- **High:** “Budget overruns and resource shortages have been observed, risking delays in migration milestones.”  
- **Critical:** “There is a significant misalignment with budget and resources, threatening the success of the migration.”

---

### Question 9: Stakeholder Engagement and Communication  
**Query:** “How are key stakeholders engaged and kept informed throughout the migration process?”  

- **Low:** “We maintain regular updates through dashboards, meetings, and documented progress reports.”  
- **Moderate:** “While there are regular updates, some communication gaps still exist among stakeholders.”  
- **High:** “Stakeholder engagement is inconsistent, causing misalignment and delays in decision-making.”  
- **Critical:** “Lack of proper communication has led to confusion and resistance, endangering project alignment with business goals.”

---

### Question 10: Risk Management and Mitigation Strategy  
**Query:** “What proactive risk management practices are in place to address potential issues during the migration?”  

- **Low:** “A detailed risk register and mitigation plan are in place, with proactive monitoring and contingency measures.”  
- **Moderate:** “Risk management practices are established, though some emerging risks have yet to be fully addressed.”  
- **High:** “There are significant risks identified that are not fully mitigated, increasing project vulnerability.”  
- **Critical:** “The absence of an effective risk management strategy exposes the project to severe risks and potential failure.”

## 4. Conclusion

This structured set of questions and example responses provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate how the ongoing migration strategy aligns with divisional technology standards. By addressing each area—from data integrity and system performance to compliance, security, and stakeholder communication—the business owner can effectively justify the assigned deviation level (Low, Moderate, High, Critical) for each strategic aspect of the project.
