# Platform Engineering IDPs: Best Practices and Tool Comparison

## Introduction to Internal Developer Portals (IDPs)  
Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) are a cornerstone of modern platform engineering, offering a unified interface where developers can access all the tools, services, and knowledge needed to build and operate software. The goal of an IDP is to **reduce cognitive load** by bringing information and capabilities into one place in an intuitive way ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20one%20thing%20they,a%20portal%20ought%20to%20have)). In practice, a well-designed portal abstracts away complexity and provides self-service features, enabling developers to work more efficiently and consistently. Platform teams increasingly treat the portal as a *product* for their internal users (developers), continually improving it to enhance the developer experience ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=1,approach)). This ‚Äúplatform-as-product‚Äù mindset means gathering feedback, understanding developer pain points, and iterating on features that truly help engineers get things done. 

Common benefits of IDPs include faster onboarding of new developers, standardization of dev workflows, centralized documentation, and improved visibility into software components. By leveraging an IDP, organizations aim to boost developer productivity and happiness, while enforcing best practices and governance in a scalable way ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=DX%20recently%20surveyed%20180%20companies,the%20results%20were%20pretty%20striking)) ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=With%20predefined%20scorecards%20like%20application,readiness%2C%20and%20increase%20security%20standards)). In this report, we delve into **industry best practices for selecting and positioning IDP platforms** and provide a detailed comparison of three popular IDP solutions ‚Äì **Spotify Backstage**, **Cortex**, and **Atlassian Compass** ‚Äì across key dimensions. We pay special attention to Backstage‚Äôs strengths and consider how Cortex or Compass might integrate with or complement an existing Backstage deployment.

## Best Practices for IDP Strategy and Vendor Selection

### Treat the Platform as a Product  
A successful internal portal requires a product mindset. Simply aggregating tools is not enough ‚Äì the IDP must provide a compelling *user experience* for developers ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=1,approach)). Treat your IDP as a product: define clear ownership (often a platform engineering team), maintain a feature roadmap, and iterate based on user feedback. This involves: 

- **User Research & Feedback Loops:** Continually gather input from developers on what they need, what‚Äôs working, and what isn‚Äôt ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=Portals%20need%20to%20provide%20compelling,service%20actions%20it)). For example, Spotify achieved ~99% internal adoption of Backstage by heavily focusing on developer needs and incentives ([Top 4 Backstage Alternatives for 2025 - Port](https://www.getport.io/blog/top-backstage-alternatives#:~:text=Top%204%20Backstage%20Alternatives%20for,organizations%20that%20tried%20to)). Starting with surveys or interviews can help identify the most valuable features to include ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=Brex%E2%80%99s%20IDP%20journey%20provides%20valuable,that%20they%20ran%20with%20DX)).  
- **Ease of Use:** Prioritize an intuitive UI and smooth developer experience. If the portal is clunky or confusing, developers won‚Äôt use it. Aim to **reduce friction** for common tasks (finding docs, spinning up a new service, checking build status, etc.) ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,Experience)). Personalization (e.g. dashboards showing relevant info for each team) can also increase usefulness ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,features%20that%20allow%20users%20to)).  
- **End-to-End Journey Support:** The portal should support developers throughout the software lifecycle ‚Äì from onboarding, to development (scaffolding new projects, accessing dev environments), through operations (deployments, incident management) ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=,code%20RBAC)) ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams)). Identify key touchpoints where the IDP can make a difference (e.g. one-click environment provisioning, or aggregating CI/CD pipelines). 

By viewing internal developers as customers of the platform, you ensure the portal delivers real value and drives voluntary adoption.

### Key Evaluation Criteria (Checklist) for IDP Tools  
When selecting an IDP solution or comparing vendors, consider the following **evaluation criteria** as a checklist ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,and%20Objectives)) ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,Experience)):

- **üí° Clarity of Goals:** First, define what you want to achieve with an ID ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,and%20Objectives))„Äë. Is your priority to speed up onboarding, improve service ownership and governance, reduce tool fragmentation, enhance DevOps metrics, or something else? Your goals will inform which platform aligns best. For example, if onboarding is key, look for strong documentation and template feature ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Once%20you%20have%20a%20list,service%20functionalities))„Äë. If governance is a focus, evaluate policy enforcement and audit capabilities.  
- **üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Experience & Usability:** Assess the UI/UX of each portal. Is it intuitive for engineers? Features like global search, clear navigation, and customizable homepages improve usabil ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,Experience)) ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=))L4„Äë. Also consider personalization ‚Äì can developers tailor what they see (e.g. favorite services, team-specific views)? A good IDP should *delight* users rather than feeling like more overhead.  
- **üîå Integration with Tooling:** Check how well the portal integrates with your existing tech stack and workf ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=,Tooling))-L4„Äë. Key integrations typically include source control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.), cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), incident management (PagerDuty, Opsgenie), observability tools (Datadog, New Relic), feature flag services, and more. The IDP should act as a *glue* between these, so verify the breadth and depth of integrations available (native plugins, APIs, webhooks). Missing integration with critical tools can be a show-stopper (one user noted Atlassian Compass had **limited integration with non-Atlassian tools**, focusing mainly on the Atlassian ecosy ([Compass Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/xoxoday-compass/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,Compass))916„Äë).  
- **üîß Extensibility & Customization:** Consider how easily you can extend or customize the portal. Does the solution support plugins or modules? Are there public APIs or an SDK for building custom extensions? An API-first or ‚Äúplatform‚Äù approach is ideal, allowing you to integrate any internal tool via APIs if n ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=readiness%2C%20and%20increase%20security%20standards))L140„Äë. **Backstage**, for instance, offers a rich plugin architecture enabling teams to add new functionality or UI modules at ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=Backstage%2C%20the%20open,Backstage%20can%20provide%20unparalleled%20flexibility))L208„Äë. **Compass** provides GraphQL APIs and an Atlassian Forge app model for custom ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=readiness%2C%20and%20increase%20security%20standards))L140„Äë. Gauge the size of the plugin ecosystem and community support ‚Äì a larger community means more ready-made extensions and faster issue resolution.  
- **üöÄ Self-Service Capabilities:** One hallmark of IDPs is empowering developers to self-serve common tasks (sometimes called *‚Äúshift left‚Äù* for ops). Evaluate if the platform allows on-demand actions like creating a new service from a template, provisioning cloud resources, setting up CI pipelines, or managing dev enviro ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=relationships,query%20and%20understand%20all%20entities))-L209„Äë. Also check for **automation features** ‚Äì e.g. can it trigger workflows or runbooks in response to events (a deployment, an incident, ([Internal developer portals: top 10 selection criteria](https://www.port.io/blog/internal-developer-portals-top-10-selection-criteria#:~:text=query%20and%20understand%20all%20entities,triggering%20runbooks%20during%20an%20incident))-L217„Äë? A good portal can integrate with infrastructure automation so that developers can accomplish tasks without filing tickets.  
- **üìñ Service Catalog & Governance:** At the core of many IDPs is a **service catalog** ‚Äì a centralized registry of software components (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, etc.), along with metadata like owners, dependencies, documentation links, and health ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))3-L121„Äë. Examine how each tool handles cataloging and governance. Key questions: Does it support flexible metadata (or is the model rigid)? Can it catalog *all* relevant component types (APIs, ML models, infrastructure, not just se ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=))7-L145„Äë? Look for features like **dependency visualization** (maps of how services connect) and **scorecards** or checks that measure compliance with standards (for example, is a service meeting security and reliability bench ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=Cortex%20markets%20itself%20as%20a,with%20greater%20insight%20and%20control)) ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=in%20a%20single%2C%20unified%20place,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))5-L123„Äë. Governance features might include policy enforcement (ensuring every service has an owner, every API has documentation, etc.) and audit trails of changes.  
- **üîí Security & Access Control:** Since an IDP surfaces internal systems, it must support enterprise security needs. Evaluate authentication and SSO integration (SAML, OAuth), as well as fine-grained **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict who can see or change cert ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Since%20an%20IDP%20often%20integrates,Consider%20these%20factors))00-L308„Äë. Audit logging of user actions is another important feature for co ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=%2A%20Access%20Controls%3A%20Role,stores%20or%20manages%20sensitive%20information))02-L310„Äë. If using a SaaS solution, review their security certifications (SOC2, ISO2700 ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=controls%20,stores%20or%20manages%20sensitive%20information))04-L310„Äë and data residency options as required.  
- **üìä Analytics and Metrics:** To treat the portal as a product, you need to measure its usage and impact. Does the platform provide **analytics on portal activity** (e.g. which pages or tools are used most, search queries made, onboarding time ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=))18‚Ä†L1-L4„Äë? Such insights can guide continuous improvement. Also consider if it tracks **DevOps metrics** for your services (Compass, for example, surfaces DORA metrics like deployment frequency and MTTR out-o ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))113-L121„Äë).  
- **üèóÔ∏è Scalability and Performance:** Ensure the solution scales with your organization. If self-hosted, can it handle thousands of services and users? If SaaS, does it have appropriate SLAs (Atlassian offers a 99.9% SLA on Compa ([Compass-Atlassian alternatives: Compare Compass to Port](https://www.getport.io/compare/compass-vs-port#:~:text=Compass,your%20best%20internal%20developer%20portal))2‚Ä†L31-L37„Äë)? Check if any performance issues are reported for large installations (like slow search at scale). Also consider maintenance complexity: an open-source tool you host might require upgrades and patches ‚Äì evaluate if your team can manage that long-term.  
- **üí∞ Pricing and Total Cost:** Finally, consider the **cost model** of each option. Backstage is open-source (no license cost), while **Cortex** and **Compass** are commercial products with subscription fees. However, ‚Äúfree‚Äù open source isn‚Äôt free to run ‚Äì you must account for engineering effort and infrastructure. Backstage‚Äôs flexibility can come with *hidden costs* in engin ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=,High%20Resource%20Requirement)) ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=To%20fully%20customize%20Backstage%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll,making%20it%20a%20costly%20solution))‚Ä†L221-L226„Äë. Some organizations report needing a team of **3‚Äì15 engineers just to maintain Backstage ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=To%20fully%20customize%20Backstage%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll,making%20it%20a%20costly%20solution))‚Ä†L221-L226„Äë. Vendors like Atlassian claim their managed solution avoids those mainte ([ Compass vs Spotify Backstage | See the differences | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/comparison/compass-vs-backstage#:~:text=Compass%20gives%20your%20engineering%20team,to%20infrastructure%20and%20hosting%20costs))2‚Ä†L98-L104„Äë. Weigh the build vs buy tradeoff: the opportunity cost of dedicating developers to portal development versus paying for a ready-to-use service. Additionally, examine licensing terms (user-based, service-based, or flat fee) and whether the pricing scales reasonably with your usage. For instance, Atlassian Compass offers a free tier (up to 3 ‚Äúfull users‚Äù free) and then ([Pricing - Compass - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/pricing#:~:text=Free%20for%20small%20teams%20looking,full%20users%2C%20unlimited%20basic%20users))s, whereas Cortex pricing is typically enterprise-negotiated. **Total cost of ownership (TCO)** should include both tool fees and the people costs to implement and operate it.

Using criteria like the above as a guide, you can create a scorecard for each option under consideration. Many companies also perform proofs-of-concept (PoCs) with 1‚Äì2 tools to evaluate real-world fit before fully committing. Keep in mind that an IDP is a long-term investment ‚Äì choosing the right platform (or combination of platforms) that can grow with your needs is critical.

### Vendor Positioning and Strategy Considerations  
A major strategic decision is whether to adopt an **open-source IDP framework** (building a customized portal in-house) or to use a **commercial off-the-shelf portal** (hosted or on-prem). Both approaches have pros and cons:

- **Open Source (Build Your Own):** The chief advantage is **control and extensibility**. You can tailor the portal exactly to your organization‚Äôs workflows and integrate any tool. **Backstage** exemplifies this approach ‚Äì it‚Äôs a framework that gives you building blocks to create a bes ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=Backstage%2C%20the%20open,Backstage%20can%20provide%20unparalleled%20flexibility))‚Ä†L200-L208„Äë. Organizations with unique requirements or heavy customization needs may favor this route. The tradeoff, as noted, is the engineering effort. Standing up Backstage is *non-trivial* and often requires a dedicated team to handle setup, plugin development, and ongoing maintenance (updates, ([Are there other good options?

Companies must budget that effort and have the necessary skills (React/TypeScript, etc ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=To%20fully%20customize%20Backstage%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll,making%20it%20a%20costly%20solution))‚Ä†L221-L229„Äë. Another risk is slower time-to-value ‚Äì what might take a vendor weeks to implement could take months in-house if starting f ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20flexibility%20of%20Backstage,time%20attention%20of%20multiple%20engineers)) ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=implementation%20process,time%20attention%20of%20multiple%20engineers))‚Ä†L216-L224„Äë. 

- **Commercial SaaS (Buy/Subscribe):** Vendor-led solutions like **Cortex** and **Atlassian Compass** position themselves as more turnkey ‚Äì they provide a fully built portal with minimal setup, and they handle operations/updates for you. This can mean much faster onboarding (Compass advertises getting started in ‚Äúdays, not months‚Äù and no mainten ([ Compass vs Spotify Backstage | See the differences | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/comparison/compass-vs-backstage#:~:text=Create%20your%20ultimate%20developer%20experience,onboarding%20and%20no%20maintenance%20costs)) ([ Compass vs Spotify Backstage | See the differences | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/comparison/compass-vs-backstage#:~:text=Compass%20gives%20your%20engineering%20team,to%20infrastructure%20and%20hosting%20costs))2‚Ä†L97-L104„Äë). It also shifts responsibility for reliability to the vendor (with support SLAs). The downsides can include **less flexibility** (you are generally constrained to the features and customization options the vendor supports) and potential **lock-in**. If the product doesn‚Äôt fit your environment perfectly, you might have limited ability to change it. Some SaaS portals have fixed data models or opinionated workflows that might not map exactly to your org (for example, a third-party analysis noted Cortex‚Äôs data model is somewhat rigid, limiting how you represent custom e ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=))‚Ä†L137-L145„Äë). Additionally, SaaS offerings are relatively new in this space; early adopters have reported that even vendors can require significant onboarding efforts (some implementations taking 6‚Äì12 months) and still need engineering time to configure i ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=It%20is%20also%20my%20observation,plugin%E2%80%94in%20a%20matter%20of%20days))‚Ä†L117-L125„Äë. **Loss of control** is a key concern ‚Äì if a feature is missing, you must rely on the vendor‚Äôs roadmap or work around it, whereas with open source you could build  ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20whether%20companies%20choose,to%20make%20your%20portal%20successful))‚Ä†L125-L134„Äë.

In practice, many organizations start with Backstage due to its strong community and proven track record, and only consider switching if the maintenance becomes too onerous or if a vendor offers compelling capabilities they lack. It‚Äôs telling that **Backstage currently dominates the IDP landscape** ‚Äì in a 2025 survey of 180 companies by DX, **89% of organizations using an IDP were using Backstage**, versus only 9% on all SaaS competito ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=Backstage%20is%20dominating%20the%20IDP,even%20higher%20for%20enterprise%20companies))36‚Ä†L79-L87„Äë. This underscores Backstage‚Äôs popularity and maturity. The same research notes that while Backstage‚Äôs upkeep costs are a common gripe, companies have voiced *an equal amount of frustration with current SaaS ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=While%20there%20are%20well,challenges%20with%20Backstage%20are%20mostly))*. In other words, no solution is without challenges, so it comes down to which trade-offs you prefer to manage.

**Positioning your IDP strategy** should involve an honest assessment of your internal capacity: Do you have the appetite and skill to invest in an open-source platform as a long-term product? If yes, Backstage can yield massive benefits and flexibility, and its large community indicates robust support and ongoing innovation. If not, a hosted solution might deliver value faster. Some organizations pursue a **hybrid approach**, leveraging open source plus selective vendor tools. For example, you could run Backstage for the core portal but integrate a SaaS service like Cortex for specialized features (e.g. scorecards for service standards). In fact, Cortex offers an official Backstage plugin that syncs Backstage‚Äôs service catalog into Cortex and surfaces Cortex‚Äôs scorecards in the B ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=Backend%20plugin))‚Ä†L160-L168„Äë. This kind of integration can provide the best of both worlds ‚Äì developers keep using the Backstage interface, while the platform team offloads certain functionality (compliance tracking, reliability stats) to the vendor‚Äôs backend. We‚Äôll discuss migration/integration considerations more in the context of each tool below.

In summary, best practices for platform strategy include: start with clear objectives, involve your developers in the selection process, weigh build vs buy in terms of total cost and flexibility, and favor solutions that can grow and adapt with your needs. Keep the focus on delivering **tangible improvements to developer productivity and happiness** ‚Äì the technology is a means to that end.

Atlassian provides a Forge SDK so you can write custom Compass apps or widgets that run in their cloud. The ecosystem is nascent compared to Backstage‚Äôs ‚Äì not as many community plugins yet, though Atlassian has some official extensions (e.g. Snyk security  ([Atlassian Compass integration | Snyk User Docs](https://docs.snyk.io/integrate-with-snyk/vulnerability-management-tools/atlassian-compass-integration#:~:text=Atlassian%20Compass%20integration%20,on%20vulnerabilities%20directly%20in))48‚Ä†L15-L23„Äë). In general, Compass offers *full integration capabilities* via API but **less UI customization** ‚Äì you cannot rewrite the whole UI, only augment it.

| **Integration Capabilities**       | Broad integration potential ‚Äì either via existing plugins or custom ones. Backstage has plugins for most CI/CD tools, SCM, cloud, monitoring, and can be configured to ingest data from various sources. E.g., plugins exist for Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub, GitLab, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Kubernetes, and more. If a plugin doesn‚Äôt exist, you can use the Backstage API to fetch data or create a new integration. However, integration is *not automatic* ‚Äì you must wire up plugins and sometimes maintain credentials/scripts. Also, synchronization of data (like keeping the service catalog updated) may require batch jobs or webhooks that you set up. (Backstage typically relies on **YAML config files** in each repo to register components; automating the creation/update of those YAMLs is something you may script or handle via plugins). | **Many built-in integrations** targeted at microservice ops: GitHub/GitLab repo import, CI pipelines, incident trackers, vulnerability scanners, etc. (Cortex‚Äôs marketing highlights easy connections to your ‚Äúentire ecosystem‚Äù for  ([Cortex | Internal Developer Portal](https://www.cortex.io/#:~:text=The%20path%20to%20engineering%20excellence,drive%20action%2C%20and%20measure%20outcomes))39‚Ä†L61-L69„Äë). It supports incoming data via webhooks or direct connectors for tools like Jira, Opsgenie, Datadog, etc. Some users note that certain integrations (especially for custom workflows) still require effort to configure, but overall Cortex provides a lot out-of-the-box (e.g., it can auto-import services from repo metadata).

| **Service Catalog & Governance**   | **Rich service catalog** is the heart of Backstage. Services, Libraries, APIs, Websites, etc. are all first-class entities defined by YAML descriptors in each repo. Backstage‚Äôs catalog UI allows browsing all components, seeing ownership (team, owner), linking to docs, and viewing relationships (system diagrams). It also has a **Software Templates** feature to scaffold new services along approved ‚Äúgo ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))‚Ä†L113-L121„Äë. For governance, Backstage itself doesn‚Äôt enforce standards out-of-the-box, but you can add plugins like Scorecards or custom checkers. Many adopters integrate linting or policy checks in CI to ensure the YAMLs meet certain criteria. There are community plugins to show compliance (for example, Spotify‚Äôs own **Backstage Scorecards** plugin was introduced to evaluate service quality agains ([Cortex vs Backstage: What's the best internal developer portal?](https://www.opslevel.com/resources/cortex-vs-backstage-whats-the-best-internal-developer-portal#:~:text=Cortex%20markets%20itself%20as%20a,with%20greater%20insight%20and%20control))‚Ä†L126-L134„Äë).

This top-down approach to quality and reliability is a core selling point. In terms of catalog data model, as noted, it‚Äôs a bit less flexible for unusual asset types, but for typical microservices and teams it captures owner, tier, lifecycle, dependencies, etc. **Automations**: Cortex can trigger workflows like creating Jira tickets or sending Slack alerts based on scorecard results (e.g., create an issue for a team if their service is out of compliance). This helps enforce governance proactively. | **Service catalog is a core feature of Compass** as well, intended as the ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù for components and the ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20helps%20teams%20tame%20software,their%20architecture%20and%20development%20velocity))‚Ä†L145-L153„Äë. Every component (service, library, etc.) in Compass can list its repository, owner team, documentation, runtime info, and links to deployments. Compass emphasizes **DevOps health metrics**: it includes **predefined scorecards** such as ‚ÄúOperational readiness‚Äù or ‚ÄúSecurity health‚Äù which aggregate metrics like deploy frequency, open incidents, or security s ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))‚Ä†L113-L121„Äë. These appear as scores or badges on services. Governance in Compass is about applying **policies via scorecards** (e.g., ensure each service has an owner and is meeting certain SRE benchmarks). However, the customization of scorecards might be limited to what Atlassian provides (at least initially ‚Äì they may allow custom metrics via API). Compass also automatically tracks dependencies and can highlight when a library or service is outdated across the organization. It‚Äôs designed to help identify problem areas at a glance and improve them. One notable governance feature is integration with Atlassian‚Äôs incident management: since Compass knows service-to-team mappings, it can help in incident escalation or post-mortems by linking incidents to the responsible components. |

### Emphasizing Backstage‚Äôs Unique Strengths  
Given that our company already uses **Backstage**, it‚Äôs important to highlight why Backstage is such a dominant player and how to leverage its strengths:

- **Unparalleled Flexibility:** Backstage is effectively a toolkit to build your perfect portal. Its plugin model and open architecture let you integrate *anything*. This is extremely powerful in a complex organization ‚Äì you‚Äôre not limited by a vendor‚Äôs roadmap. If you need to onboard a homegrown internal tool into the portal, you can do it. If you want to create a custom view (say, a UI showing cross-service dependency risk), you have full freedom to develop it. This flexibility is why **89% of organizations choosing an IDP went wit ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=Backstage%20is%20dominating%20the%20IDP,even%20higher%20for%20enterprise%20companies))36‚Ä†L79-L87„Äë** ‚Äì it adapts to varied needs. Our company can shape Backstage to support our specific developer workflows and terminology, ensuring the portal feels native to our environment. 

- **Vibrant Ecosystem:** Backstage‚Äôs open-source ecosystem is a huge asset. Hundreds of plugins are available publicly, contributed by Spotify and the community. These cover a wide range of functionality ‚Äì from CI/CD integrations, to cloud resource browsers, to security vulnerability dashboards. For example, Backstage has plugins for PagerDuty and OpsGenie to show on-call rotations, for Jira to show tickets related to a component, for GitHub to surface repo insights, and many more. New plugins keep appearing (recently, an iLert plugin for incident management was contributed, adding rich on-call and uptime monitoring features right i ([Backstage Weekly 27 - Expedia Case Study | Roadie](https://roadie.io/blog/backstage-weekly-27-expedia-case-study/#:~:text=Yet%20another%20official%20corporate%20Backstage,mean%20this%20thing%20has%20features))25‚Ä†L69-L77„Äë). Companies sponsoring plugins indicate the growth: **‚Äúit‚Äôs really cool to see corporate-sponsored plugins appear‚Ä¶ a good indication of the level of adoption and growth Backstage is ([Backstage Weekly 27 - Expedia Case Study | Roadie](https://roadie.io/blog/backstage-weekly-27-expedia-case-study/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20really%20cool%20to%20see,growth%20that%20Backstage%20is%20seeing))25‚Ä†L85-L87„Äë. By using Backstage, we tap into this innovation ‚Äì we can adopt proven plugins instead of building from scratch. Moreover, if we encounter a challenge, there‚Äôs likely a community discussion or existing solution available.

- **Strong Service Catalog and Developer Workflow Features:** Out of the box, Backstage provides the backbone for a developer portal: a catalog that is language-agnostic and stores whatever metadata we define, plus a software templating system for scaffolding new projects with our best practices. **Software Templates** are a killer feature ‚Äì we can create templates for, say, a standard microservice, and developers can bootstrap a new repo with all configs (CI, Docker, monitoring) in one click vi ([Atlassian Compass - Platform tooling](https://platformengineering.org/tools/compass#:~:text=Compass%20is%20a%20developer%20experience,their%20distributed%20architecture%20and%20teams))‚Ä†L113-L121„Äë. This enforces consistency (a key platform engineering goal) and saves time. **TechDocs** is another powerful feature ‚Äì it allows teams to write Markdown docs in their repos and Backstage will auto-generate a documentation site for each service (with search and everything), all accessible through ([The Ultimate Guide to Backstage Software Catalog Completeness](https://roadie.io/blog/3-strategies-for-a-complete-software-catalog/#:~:text=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Backstage,speed%20up%20engineer%20onboarding))24‚Ä†L17-L21„Äë. Many Backstage adopters cite these features as quick wins that improved developer happiness (engineers can find docs and create services much faster than before). 

- **Proven at Scale:** Backstage originated at Spotify, where it scaled to **hundreds of engineers and services**. Many Fortune 500 companies now use it, indicating it can handle enterprise scale and complexity. Adopters like **Netflix, Expedia, LinkedIn, American Airlines, VMware** and more give confidence in Backstage‚Äôs ([Backstage Wrapped 2022](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022/#:~:text=Backstage%20Wrapped%202022%20Companies%20like,joined%20the%20community%20this)) ([#93: Backstage: everything you need to know - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/93-backstage-everything-you-need-know-luca-galante-gszuf#:~:text=Backstage%20is%20the%20first%20,as%20a%20software%20and))35‚Ä†L23-L25„Äë. This maturity also means there‚Äôs a wealth of knowledge on best practices for implementing Backstage successfully. For instance, Spotify and others have shared ‚Äúadoption strategies‚Äù ‚Äì such as gradually rolling out the portal, seeding it with content, marketing it internally, and even incentiv ([How Spotify Achieved a Voluntary 99% Internal Platform Adoption ...](https://thenewstack.io/how-spotify-achieved-a-voluntary-99-internal-platform-adoption-rate/#:~:text=,developers%20onboard%20with%20platform%20engineering))e. Following these proven approaches can help us maximize our Backstage‚Äôs impact. 

- **Continuous Improvement and CNCF Backing:** Backstage is under active development, now in the CNCF (which also hosts Kubernetes, etc.). This ensures a neutral governance and long-term sustainability. New features and improvements are regularly released. The Backstage core team has been addressing pain points like simplifying upgrades and stabilizing APIs to reduce those ‚Äúbreaking changes‚Äù that caus ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=While%20there%20are%20well,challenges%20with%20Backstage%20are%20mostly))n. A dedicated community track (Backstage Community Sessions) shares updates and allows adopters to connect. By sticking with Backstage, we benefit from these ongoing enhancements and can even influence them by contributing or voicing our needs.

- **Inner Source and Collaboration:** An often overlooked strength of an open platform is the ability to **inner-source contributions within our company**. Because Backstage is just code, our developers (not only the platform team) can contribute plugins or improvements that benefit everyone. This can foster a culture of collaboration on developer experience. Some companies encourage teams to build their own plugins for the portal ‚Äì making the IDP a true collective product. This is harder to do with a closed SaaS product.

In summary, Backstage‚Äôs unique strengths lie in it being *your* portal, on *your* terms, supercharged by a global community. It provides the building blocks for an IDP that exactly fits our company‚Äôs DNA, and it has a track record of delivering major efficiency gains when implemented well. Given we already use Backstage, doubling down on these strengths ‚Äì by investing in plugin development, catalog coverage, and developer engagement ‚Äì is likely the right path. 

### Migration or Integration Considerations (Backstage with Cortex or Compass)  
While Backstage serves as our primary portal, there could be scenarios to integrate or even migrate to other platforms for additional benefits. Here we outline considerations for **Cortex or Compass integration**:

- **Integrating Cortex with Backstage:** Instead of a full migration, one strategy is to **augment Backstage with Cortex** for its governance and standards features. Cortex provides an official Backstage plugin that essentially *syncs* Backstage‚Äôs catalog to Cortex‚Äôs backend and then displays Cortex data (like scorecard results) withi ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=Backend%20plugin))‚Ä†L160-L168„Äë. This means we can keep our Backstage UI as the one-stop portal for developers, but behind the scenes use Cortex to run compliance checks, track scorecards, and leverage Cortex‚Äôs UI for the platform team. For example, after installing the plugin, each service page in Backstage can show a ‚ÄúCortex‚Äù tab with that service‚Äôs health score, open action  ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=tab%3A)) ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=Backend%20plugin))‚Ä†L160-L168„Äë. The **sync** is handled by a Cortex backend plugin that converts Backstage YAML to Cortex‚Äôs format au ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=The%20backend%20plugin%20is%20responsible,take%20care%20of%20that%20automatically))‚Ä†L162-L170„Äë. This integration path is quite straightforward and lets us trial Cortex‚Äôs value without disrupting developers. If Cortex proves valuable (e.g., we see improved SRE metrics or easier audits), we can continue with a hybrid approach or even consider moving more functionality to Cortex. The main effort is setting up the data sync and perhaps adjusting our catalog data to fit Cortex‚Äôs requirements (we might need to ensure certain annotations exist for scorecards to work). **No heavy migration** is needed since Backstage and Cortex can co-exist and share data.

- **Migrating to Atlassian Compass:** A migration from Backstage to Compass would be more of a *transition* than a live integration, as Compass does not have an out-of-the-box bridge to Backstage. If we contemplated moving to Compass (for example, to offload maintenance completely), we‚Äôd have to **import our data and workflows into Compass**. Atlassian Compass can import components from GitHub or other git repositories au ([Integrate Compass with GitHub - Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/compass/docs/integrate-compass-with-github/#:~:text=Integrate%20Compass%20with%20GitHub%20,component%20management%20from%20an))48‚Ä†L19-L27„Äë. This suggests that if our Backstage catalog is source-of-truth (likely stored as YAML in git), Compass could ingest those same repository files to populate its catalog. We would need to map our Backstage component definitions to Compass‚Äôs model ‚Äì Compass might not support all the custom metadata we have, so a data mapping exercise is necessary. In terms of features, we‚Äôd look to recreate key Backstage functionality in Compass: for instance, Backstage software templates might map to Compass‚Äôs templates (Compass does support templating for new ([ Compass vs Spotify Backstage | See the differences | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/comparison/compass-vs-backstage#:~:text=,and%20ship%20faster%20with%20templates))). Documentation might move to Compass by linking Confluence pages or using Compass‚Äôs tabs to show documentation. One big consideration is **attachments**: any internal plugins we built on Backstage wouldn‚Äôt directly carry over. We‚Äôd have to see if Compass offers equivalent capabilities or if custom Compass apps can be written to replace them. The **effort to migrate** would include training developers on the new tool and ensuring all existing use cases are covered. On the plus side, if we migrate fully, we eliminate the infrastructure burden ‚Äì Atlassian takes over that role.

- **Running Backstage and Compass in Parallel:** It‚Äôs also possible to use Compass in a limited scope alongside Backstage. For example, Compass‚Äôs free tier could be used by the platform team to experiment with its component catalog and health metrics, while developers continue primarily in Backstage. However, having two portals could confuse users, so if Compass were adopted, it might ultimately replace Backstage‚Äôs front-end for consistency. One could envision a scenario where Backstage is gradually phased out after Compass proves itself, but we‚Äôd want to do this only if Compass demonstrably meets all needs. Given Backstage‚Äôs deep integration in our workflows, a rip-and-replace is not trivial ‚Äì hence why integration (in Cortex‚Äôs case) or a very gradual transition (in Compass‚Äôs case) is advised if we go down that path.

- **Data Portability:** Both Cortex and Compass use the concept of a service catalog with metadata. We should ensure our data (service definitions, ownership info, etc.) is maintained accurately during any integration or migration. Fortunately, since Backstage stores data in YAML and both target platforms have APIs, we could export and import programmatically. For instance, we could write a script to push each Backstage component to Compass via its GraphQL API if needed. Similarly, for Cortex, the provided plugin already handles data sync. This means vendor lock-in of data is relatively low ‚Äì the *structure* might differ but the core info (service name, description, owner, etc.) is transferable.

- **Process and Feature Alignment:** If integrating with Cortex, we should align on **workflow**: e.g., decide if developers will look at Cortex‚Äôs UI at all or strictly use Backstage UI. Likely, developers keep using Backstage; platform owners and management might use Cortex‚Äôs interface for reports and configuring scorecards. If migrating to Compass, we need to align our processes (incident management, deployment tracking) with Atlassian‚Äôs way ‚Äì which might actually simplify things if we already use Jira, Opsgenie, Bitbucket widely. Compass could unify those links without custom dev work.

- **Trial/Pilot Recommendations:** A best practice is to run a pilot with a subset of services and users. For example, enable the Cortex plugin for one team‚Äôs services and let them and the SREs test the scorecard system‚Äôs effectiveness. Or trial Compass on a small project that‚Äôs less critical, to see how it compares to our Backstage. This minimizes risk and provides insight before any major decision.

**Bottom line:** We should view Backstage, Cortex, and Compass not strictly as mutually exclusive choices, but as components we can mix to craft our optimal platform. Backstage remains our core due to its heavy adoption internally, and rightly so given its strengths. Cortex can be seen as a *complement* for governance if we desire more of that capability without building it ourselves ‚Äì and the integration is already available, making it a low- ([Cortex Plugin for Backstage - Setup Guide & How To Use | Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/post/cortex-plugin-for-backstage#:~:text=The%20backend%20plugin%20is%20responsible,take%20care%20of%20that%20automatically))‚Ä†L162-L170„Äë. Compass represents an alternative route ‚Äì a more integrated suite, but moving to it would be a strategic shift that requires weighing the loss of some flexibility against the gain of offloading maintenance. At present, the **industry best practice** for anyone already invested in Backstage is to fully exploit Backstage‚Äôs ecosystem (perhaps augment with plugins or third-party integrations) rather than switch, unless there is a compelling pain point. As one recent industry analysis concluded: *‚ÄúGenerally, I think the answer is yes [use Backstage]. ‚Ä¶ the challenges with Backstage are mostly IDP category challenges‚Ä¶ and the Achilles‚Äô heel of current SaaS solutions is you lose control and flexibility needed to build the features to make your portal su ([Backstage is dominating the developer portal market](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/backstage-and-the-developer-portal-market#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20whether%20companies%20choose,to%20make%20your%20portal%20successful))‚Ä†L125-L134„Äë This aligns with our emphasis on Backstage‚Äôs advantages. However, we stay open to integrating specialized tools like Cortex for specific gaps, following a **hybrid strategy** if it yields the best outcome for our developers and reliability goals.

## Conclusion and Recommendations  
In the evolving landscape of Internal Developer Platforms, **Backstage, Cortex, and Atlassian Compass** each occupy a distinct position. Backstage offers a powerful, community-driven framework that has become the industry standard for bespoke developer portals ‚Äì it excels in extensibility, community support, and the ability to create a developer experience uniquely tailored to an organization‚Äôs needs. Cortex delivers strong out-of-the-box governance and service quality management, appealing to organizations that want to quickly implement standards and improve reliability across hundreds of microservices. Atlassian Compass provides a lightweight, integrated approach, especially attractive to those already in the Atlassian ecosystem or those who prefer a managed solution with minimal upkeep and immediate features like scorecards and metrics.

**Strategic best practices** suggest that any IDP initiative should be guided by the ‚Äúplatform as product‚Äù philosophy: keep the focus on developers (your internal customers), iterate based on their feedback, and measure success (onboarding time, deployment frequency, incident reduction, etc.) to demons ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Final%20Thoughts%3A%20Prioritizing%20Continuous%20Improvement)) ([Evaluating Internal Developer Portals: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.harness.io/blog/evaluating-internal-developer-portals-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Evaluating%20an%20internal%20developer%20portal,to%20do%20their%20best%20work))‚Ä†L314-L323„Äë. No matter which tool or combination of tools you choose, success will depend on driving adoption ‚Äì making the portal the path of least resistance for developers. That means populating it with useful content, automating data updates so it‚Äôs always fresh (no stale info), and marketing its benefits internally (e.g., showcasing quick wins like how a new hire deployed a service on day one using the portal).

For our company, with Backstage already in place, the recommendation is to **build on that foundation**. Leverage Backstage‚Äôs strengths: expand our plugin usage to integrate any missing tools, improve our software templates to cover all common use cases, and possibly introduce plugins like Cortex‚Äôs scorecards if we see a need for better standards enforcement. It‚Äôs advisable to allocate dedicated ownership (if not already) ‚Äì a small team or guild responsible for Backstage upkeep and improvements, treating it as a living product. This team can track community updates (so we can upgrade smoothly and benefit from new features) and coordinate contributions from other teams.

When evaluating any new vendor or tool in this space, use the **evaluation checklist** outlined above to systematically compare how each option meets our goals. Specifically, **developer experience and integration** should be top priorities ‚Äì a portal that doesn‚Äôt play well with our existing tools or that developers find hard to use will not succeed regardless of features. **Total cost of ownership** is another critical factor; sometimes the ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù tool upfront may cost more in lost time or limited capabilities, so think long term. 

If we decide to trial Cortex or Compass, do so in a controlled manner and measure outcomes. For example, if Cortex is piloted, track metrics like number of outdated dependencies or incidents before vs. after ‚Äì see if its introduction correlates with improvements (thus justifying its cost). If Compass is evaluated, ensure that it can incorporate our current portal data and check that no key feature is lost in translation ‚Äì the goal would be to see if it truly can replace Backstage‚Äôs core value with less effort. At the same time, observe developer sentiment ‚Äì do they prefer one interface over another?

In terms of **vendor positioning**, maintain a pragmatic stance: Backstage‚Äôs open nature means we are never locked in ‚Äì we control our destiny. Adding a vendor like Cortex or Compass should not result in dependence on proprietary data silos; as noted, both provide APIs to get data out if needed. It‚Äôs wise to avoid over-reliance on any single vendor‚Äôs proprietary features unless they are overwhelmingly beneficial, to keep our flexibility open. Fortunately, the trends indicate even SaaS IDP vendors recognize the need for openness (Compass with GraphQL API, Cortex syncing with Backstage YAML, etc.).

Finally, align the IDP strategy with our broader platform engineering roadmap. If the company is investing in cloud self-service, continuous delivery, DevOps culture, etc., the IDP is the **interface** that will surface those efforts to developers. Make sure the portal evolves in tandem with platform improvements ‚Äì e.g., when new self-service capabilities are built, integrate them into the portal‚Äôs UI. Over time, a well-curated IDP becomes the **single pane of glass** for development ‚Äì a competitive advantage that accelerates engineering velocity and quality.

By adhering to these best practices and leveraging the strengths of Backstage (with thoughtful consideration of Cortex or Compass where appropriate), we can craft an internal developer portal strategy that maximizes developer experience, operational excellence, and business value.
