Archetype List:

Single-Tenant Database Archetype:

Multi-Tenant Database with Shared Schema Archetype:
	All tenants share the same database and schema.
	Data is differentiated using a Tenant ID column.
	Efficient for large numbers of tenants but with limited customization.
Multi-Tenant Database with Isolated Schemas Archetype:
	Each tenant has a separate schema within the same database.
	Combines some isolation with cost efficiency.
	Suitable for use cases with moderate customization requirements.
Hybrid Multi-Tenant Archetype:
	A combination of isolated and shared storage for flexibility.
	High-usage tenants may get dedicated schemas or databases, while others share a common one.
	Balances cost and performance.
Tenant-Based Microservices Archetype:
	Each microservice is responsible for managing a specific data domain with tenant context.
	Provides scalability and modularity by isolating tenant logic per service.
Data Aggregation Archetype:
	Aggregates tenant-specific data into a unified data lake or warehouse.
	Useful for analytics and reporting across multiple tenants.
	Ensures data aggregation without violating tenant privacy.
Federated Multi-Tenant Architecture Archetype:
	Multiple independent tenant instances are federated through a common access layer.
	Allows seamless access while maintaining autonomy per tenant.
Customizable Data Model Archetype:
	Tenants can extend core data models with custom fields.
	Uses metadata-driven approaches to maintain flexibility without core code changes.
High-Availability Multi-Tenant Archetype:
	Designed for fault tolerance with tenant-specific failover strategies.
	Supports data replication and disaster recovery tailored per tenant.
Event-Driven Tenant Architecture:
	Utilizes message queues or event streams to process tenant-specific actions asynchronously.
	Supports real-time data updates and integration.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Archetype:
	Each tenant is treated as a bounded context.
	Uses aggregate roots and domain entities to encapsulate tenant logic.
Zero-Downtime Deployment Archetype:
	Ensures that new features or changes are deployed without impacting tenant availability.
	Uses versioned APIs and blue-green deployment strategies.
Self-Service Tenant Management Archetype:
	Provides a management portal for tenants to configure and manage their own settings.
	Reduces administrative overhead and increases tenant autonomy.
Edge Computing Tenant Archetype:
	Distributes tenant-specific data processing to edge nodes.
	Minimizes latency for geographically dispersed tenants.
Serverless Multi-Tenant Archetype:
	Uses serverless functions to handle tenant-specific operations.
	Cost-efficient for sporadic tenant workloads.
======================================================================================================================================
Data Gravity Key Concepts:

Data Location and Proximity:
	Data tends to accumulate and attract applications, services, and processing to its location.
	Consider the geographical location of data storage to minimize latency.
Data Volume and Mass:
	Larger datasets have more gravitational pull, making it harder to move.
	Assess the volume of tenant data and its impact on system performance.
Data Residency and Sovereignty:
	Compliance requirements (like GDPR) can dictate where tenant data must be stored.
	Ensure data residency rules are respected when choosing data centers.
Data Integration Complexity:
	Integrating with external systems becomes more challenging as data volume and location vary.
	Use APIs and middleware to streamline data access.
Data Inertia:
	Once data accumulates in a particular location, it becomes resistant to movement.
	Consider the long-term consequences of data placement decisions.
Latency and Performance Impact:
	Co-locating data and processing minimizes latency.
	Design the architecture to balance proximity to both data and computation.
Data Synchronization Challenges:
	Moving data between different locations can cause synchronization delays.
	Employ distributed databases or eventual consistency models.
Data Movement Cost:
	Transferring large volumes of data across regions or between clouds can incur high costs.
	Monitor data egress charges and optimize movement patterns.
Data Storage Efficiency:
	Utilize data compression and deduplication to reduce storage mass.
	Ensure data is stored efficiently to minimize its gravitational effect.
Tenant Data Concentration:
	High-density tenant data can affect performance if too concentrated in one location.
	Distribute tenant data strategically to maintain system balance.
Network Bandwidth Limitations:
	Moving data frequently or in large quantities can overwhelm network resources.
	Implement smart data transfer techniques, like delta updates.
Data Replication and Caching:
	Use replication to reduce data gravity impact, keeping data copies closer to where processing occurs.
	Caching frequently accessed data improves performance and reduces latency.
Vendor and Cloud Lock-In:
	Data gravity can cause lock-in with specific cloud providers or architectures.
	Design with data portability in mind to mitigate long-term risks.
Data Access Patterns:
	Monitor how tenants access and interact with data.
	Optimize data distribution based on access frequency and user location.
Data Lifecycle Management:
	Establish policies for archiving, purging, and moving dormant data to reduce mass.
	Automate data lifecycle processes to reduce manual overhead.
