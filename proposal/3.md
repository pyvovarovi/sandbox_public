Below is a table with hypothetical examples for an unsupported data movement framework at each dependency level, along with explanations:

| Dependency Level | Example | Explanation |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Low**        | A legacy file transfer script used for moving non-critical backup logs between systems. | Although the framework is unsupported, its failure has minimal impact because the data is non-critical, and manual intervention can be applied if necessary. |
| **Moderate**   | An outdated ETL tool used to generate weekly management reports. | The unsupported framework poses some riskâ€”if it fails, report generation may be delayed. However, alternate manual processes or batch exports can be used, limiting the operational impact. |
| **High**       | An unsupported real-time data replication engine that synchronizes operational databases. | This tool is integral to daily business operations. Its failure could result in significant operational delays, affecting key business functions even though some workarounds might be available. |
| **Critical**   | An unsupported data movement framework responsible for secure, real-time transfer of financial transaction data. | The framework is essential to core operations. Any disruption may lead to immediate financial loss, compliance issues, or severe reputational damage, with no adequate fallback process available. |

These examples illustrate how the risk and impact of using an unsupported data movement framework can vary, from a scenario with minimal disruption to one with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Below is a table outlining examples for a data consolidation strategy across different dependency levels, along with corresponding explanations:

| Dependency Level | Example | Explanation |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Low**        | Consolidating non-critical marketing analytics data using a simple ETL script. | This process aggregates data from a few sources where delays have minimal impact. Manual workarounds are sufficient in case of failure. |
| **Moderate**   | Weekly consolidation of sales data from regional offices using an older ETL tool. | While the consolidated data supports routine reporting, delays would cause minor setbacks. Alternative methods or manual adjustments can mitigate the impact. |
| **High**       | Real-time consolidation of operational data into a central dashboard using a legacy integration tool. | The strategy is vital for day-to-day decision-making. Any disruption could lead to significant operational delays, affecting timely responses. |
| **Critical**   | Centralized, real-time consolidation of financial and compliance data across multiple systems for regulatory reporting. | This mission-critical consolidation is essential for accurate financial reporting and regulatory compliance; any failure can result in severe financial and reputational risks. |

These examples illustrate how the impact and risks associated with data consolidation strategies vary according to the dependency level of the systems involved.

Below is a table with examples for architecture component selection across different dependency levels, along with explanations:

| Dependency Level | Example | Explanation |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Low**        | Selection of a lightweight UI component library for non-critical interface enhancements. | This component improves aesthetics and minor interactions, but its failure or replacement has minimal impact on overall system functionality. |
| **Moderate**   | Choosing a middleware component for caching non-sensitive data. | While this component boosts performance, its temporary unavailability can be managed with fallback strategies, without disrupting core business processes. |
| **High**       | Selecting an authentication service for managing user identity and access. | This component is crucial for security and user management; issues here could significantly affect system access and require prompt remediation. |
| **Critical**   | Implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for financial operations. | This component is essential for maintaining data consistency and operational integrity; any failure could lead to catastrophic financial or operational disruptions. |

These examples illustrate how the importance and risk of an architecture component vary, guiding selection decisions based on system dependency levels.
