## Tenant
A **tenant** represents a logically isolated entity (e.g., team, department, or user group) using shared infrastructure, resources, or services provided by an Internal Development Platform.

**Key aspects:**

- **Isolation:** Logical separation of data, configurations, and access controls to prevent cross-tenant interference.
- **Customization:** Ability to customize configurations and settings according to tenant-specific requirements.
- **Resource Allocation:** Dedicated or controlled allocation of shared resources (compute, storage, network).

### Types of Tenant Models:
| Model | Explanation | Typical Use in IDP Context |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Single Tenant (Dedicated)** | Each tenant receives dedicated resources and instances of the platform. | High-security scenarios, heavily regulated departments, or distinct business units. |
| **Multi-Tenant (Shared)** | Multiple tenants share resources, services, and infrastructure, but remain logically isolated. | Common internal services (e.g., CI/CD, infrastructure management) shared across teams. |
| **Hybrid Tenant** | Combination of single-tenant and multi-tenant setups to balance isolation and resource efficiency. | Enterprise-scale IDP, balancing regulated vs. standard teams. |

## Multi-Tenancy
**Multi-Tenancy** refers to an architectural design pattern in which a single instance of software infrastructure or services simultaneously supports multiple logically isolated tenants.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Shared Infrastructure:** Common underlying resources (servers, databases, APIs).
- **Isolation:** Logical separation of data and workloads between tenants.
- **Scalability:** Efficient scaling of shared resources to serve additional tenants.

### Multi-Tenancy Approaches:
| Approach | Explanation | Application in IDP |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Database-per-Tenant** | Each tenant gets its own dedicated database within a shared platform. | Strong isolation, moderate resource efficiency. Suitable for regulated environments or sensitive data. |
| **Schema-per-Tenant** | Shared databases, but dedicated schemas for each tenant. | Balanced isolation with improved resource utilization. Ideal for moderately sensitive environments. |
| **Row-level Isolation (Shared Schema)** | Data from multiple tenants stored in the same schema with tenant-specific identifiers. | Highly resource-efficient, lower isolation. Suitable for generic workloads and internal development tooling. |

## Terminology and Concepts in IDP Multi-Tenancy:

| Term | Explanation | Relevance to IDP |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Tenant Isolation** | Techniques to ensure data, resource, and configuration isolation among tenants. | Critical for maintaining security, compliance, and performance in IDP. |
| **Tenant Provisioning** | Automated or manual setup of resources and configuration for a new tenant. | Streamlines onboarding of new teams or departments onto the IDP. |
| **Resource Quotas** | Limits on the amount of resources (compute, memory, storage, API calls) allocated to a tenant. | Ensures fair distribution, preventing tenant monopolization of platform resources. |
| **Tenant Lifecycle Management** | Processes governing tenant creation, suspension, backup, archival, and deletion. | Essential for efficient management and cost optimization. |
| **Tenant-aware APIs** | APIs designed to handle requests based on tenant identifiers. | Provides tenant-specific data or actions through shared service endpoints. |
| **Data Gravity** | Influence of large datasets within a tenant environment that attracts related applications and services. | Key consideration in multi-tenant data architectures. |
| **Federated Authentication** | Centralized identity and access management solutions integrated across tenants. | Streamlines access management and provides consistent user experience in IDP. |

## Architectural Considerations:

When implementing multi-tenancy in an internal development platform, the following considerations apply:

| Consideration | Explanation | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Security & Compliance** | Ensuring isolation meets internal security standards and regulatory compliance. | Dictates multi-tenancy approach (e.g., database-per-tenant). |
| **Performance** | Maintaining consistent performance across all tenants, preventing noisy neighbor scenarios. | Influences resource allocation and quotas. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Optimizing shared resource utilization while maintaining isolation standards. | Balances between tenant isolation levels and cost considerations. |
| **Flexibility & Customization** | Supporting varying requirements of tenants regarding features, integrations, and custom workflows. | Impacts architecture decisions on shared versus dedicated resources. |

**Summary:**

In the context of an **Internal Development Platform (IDP)**, effectively managing tenants and adopting multi-tenancy architectures ensure security, resource efficiency, scalability, and compliance, enabling multiple internal teams to leverage common infrastructure while preserving necessary boundaries.
