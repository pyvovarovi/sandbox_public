# Platform Engineering: How It Fits into DevOps and Cloud Development

**Platform engineering** is emerging as a pivotal practice in modern software teams, promising to improve developer productivity and streamline operations. As organizations scale their use of cloud services and DevOps practices, many have introduced platform engineering to bridge gaps and reduce complexity. This article provides a comprehensive breakdown of what platform engineering is, why it arose, how it works (especially through Internal Developer Platforms), and how it compares to established roles like DevOps and cloud engineering. We will examine the major points step by step, in a neutral and informative tone.

## Why Platform Engineering Emerged

Whenever a new concept or role gains traction in tech, it’s usually solving a problem that existing approaches struggled with. **Platform engineering** is no exception. To understand its rise, it helps to look at how software delivery teams evolved. In traditional IT setups, development and operations were separate silos – developers wrote code, then “threw it over the wall” to operations teams to deploy and run it. This often led to slow, inflexible processes since developers waited on ops for infrastructure changes, and ops waited on developers to fix issues ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Initially%2C%20we%20had%20developers%20and,servers%20or%20Jenkins%20%C2%A0pipeline%20for)) ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=application%20runtime%20etc)). The DevOps movement addressed this by uniting dev and ops into cross-functional teams, eliminating communication barriers and speeding up delivery ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=So%20when%20%C2%A0DevOps%20was%20introduced,now%20owns%20the%20application%20as)).  

DevOps was a huge improvement in agility: one **DevOps team** could now build, ship, and run an application end-to-end. However, this new freedom brought new challenges. With great power comes great *responsibility* – and cognitive load. Suddenly, each product team (or each “DevOps team”) had to manage not just code but a **complex stack of infrastructure and tooling**: setting up CI/CD pipelines, writing Infrastructure as Code scripts, maintaining Kubernetes clusters, configuring monitoring, security scanning, and more ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Now%20you%E2%80%99re%20having%20one%20DevOps%C2%A0,and%20new%20versions%20come%20out)) ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=And%20this%20increases%20the%20flexibility,secret%20management%20and%20so%20on)). Every team might implement these things in their own way. In an organization with, say, 10 product teams, you could end up with **10 different ways** to build and deploy software, each team reinventing similar pipelines and platforms for their apps ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Now%20Imagine%20%2C%20if%20you,individual%20engineers%20in%20those%20teams)) ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=human%20resource%20costs%2C%C2%A0%20and%20finally,this%C2%A0%20becomes%20hard%20to%20scale)). This duplication is inefficient and hard to scale. Teams became **bogged down** in operational work, which slowed down feature delivery – exactly what DevOps was meant to avoid ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20this%20approach%20has%20its,Enter%20bugs%20and%20technical%20debt)). In complex systems (e.g. running on Kubernetes), teams sometimes spent more effort wrangling infrastructure than building business logic ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=And%20with%20complex%C2%A0%20systems%20like,this%C2%A0%20becomes%20hard%20to%20scale)).

Enter **platform engineering**. It emerged to solve these issues by reducing the burden on individual dev teams. In essence, platform engineering introduces a dedicated team to **standardize and centralize the tooling and environments** that all developers use ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Enter%20platform%20engineering%21%20This%20approach,engineers%20focus%20on%20their%20applications)). Rather than each squad inventing its own way to deploy and operate software, a platform team provides a common foundation – an “internal platform” – that all can share. This allows developers to focus on coding and delivering features, without needing to be experts in every operational detail ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20this%20approach%20has%20its,Enter%20bugs%20and%20technical%20debt)) ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Enter%20platform%20engineering%21%20This%20approach,engineers%20focus%20on%20their%20applications)). The rise of platform engineering can thus be seen as an **evolution of DevOps**, keeping the DevOps culture of collaboration but adding a layer of infrastructure and tooling expertise to support all product teams.

## Standardizing Tools Across Teams

A core principle of platform engineering is **standardization**. Instead of every team choosing its own CI/CD system, container platform, or monitoring stack, the platform engineering function identifies the best tools for the organization and makes them available as shared services. In other words, platform engineers **take the tools needed to deploy and run applications and formalize their usage across the company** ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Platform%20Engineers%20take%20the%20tools,to%20its%20end%20users)). For example, if multiple teams need continuous integration pipelines, the platform team might provide a centrally managed CI/CD service (like a common Jenkins or GitLab CI instance) for everyone ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Platform%20Engineers%20take%20the%20tools,to%20its%20end%20users)). If everyone is using Kubernetes but each team configured it differently, the platform team can offer a standard Kubernetes-based environment with best-practice configurations. 

By doing this, platform engineering addresses the inconsistency and “fragmentation” that can happen in fast-moving DevOps orgs. It **reduces duplicate effort** (teams don’t all build the same thing in parallel) and ensures that critical infrastructure is set up correctly by experts. As one analysis puts it, platform engineers essentially **standardize everything that falls under an application’s non-functional requirements** ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Platform%20Engineers%20take%20the%20tools,to%20its%20end%20users)) ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=Platform%20engineers%20bring%20the%20necessary,functional%20requirements)) – the aspects like deployment, scalability, and security which aren’t features of the code itself, but are necessary to run the software. This creates a more stable, unified backbone for all development teams.

In practice, platform engineering often defines clear **roles** for using these standardized tools. Typically there are two categories of users for any internal platform service ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=1,operates%20and%20manages%20the%C2%A0%20tool)):

- **Platform administrators (platform team)** – They set up, operate, and manage the tool or service. For instance, the platform team might install and maintain a monitoring system or artifact repository.
- **Developers (application teams)** – They are the consumers of the tool, using it for their day-to-day needs. For example, app developers would use the provided CI/CD system to run their builds and deployments, or use the standardized Kubernetes platform to deploy their containers.

Once the platform (admin) team prepares a tool for use, developers can self-service it for their projects ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=1,operates%20and%20manages%20the%C2%A0%20tool)). This way, the organization leverages the **expertise** of the platform engineers more smartly across multiple teams ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=These%20roles%20can%20be%20splitted,smart%20way%C2%A0%20across%20the%20teams)). A small group of specialists can empower many developers by maintaining common infrastructure, rather than each team needing its own full-fledged DevOps specialists for every tool.

## Tackling Non-Functional Requirements

In software development, **non-functional requirements** refer to all the operational aspects that support the product – things like reliability, performance, security, compliance, and scalability. These are “requirements” in the sense that any production system must meet them (users expect fast, secure, reliable apps), but they are not features visible to the end-user. Platform engineering explicitly focuses on these needs. A popular way to describe it is that platform engineering **“encompasses everything that is part of the application’s non-functional requirements.”** ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=Platform%20engineers%20bring%20the%20necessary,functional%20requirements))

This means the platform team is responsible for providing solutions for logging, monitoring, configuring infrastructure, ensuring security best practices, handling deployments, etc. Developers using the platform don’t have to individually reinvent those wheels; the platform takes care of them. Ensuring consistent attention to non-functional requirements is critical – it bakes in security and reliability from the start instead of leaving them as afterthoughts or letting standards drift between teams ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=Platform%20engineers%20bring%20the%20necessary,functional%20requirements)). For example, the platform might offer a deployment pipeline that automatically includes security scans and compliance checks, so every team’s code is vetted in the same way. Or the platform could enforce baseline performance monitoring on all services. By centralizing these concerns, companies avoid scenarios where one team’s service falls behind on security patches or where an inconsistent approach causes outages. In short, platform engineering makes sure the important **“behind-the-scenes” qualities** of software (like stability and security) are consistently addressed across all projects.

## Platform Engineering Responsibilities

So, what exactly does a **platform engineer** or platform team do day-to-day? Their responsibilities generally include **designing, building, and maintaining the internal platform** that developers use. This is a broad mandate, but some key duties are:

- **Infrastructure Management:** Platform engineers build and manage the underlying infrastructure that supports development and deployments ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=A%20platform%20engineer%E2%80%99s%20responsibilities%20are,to%20automate%20cloud%20resources)). They might provision cloud resources, set up container orchestration platforms, or manage clusters and networks that all teams share.
- **Toolchain Integration:** They select and integrate the necessary tools for software delivery – source repositories, CI/CD pipelines, artifact registries, monitoring dashboards, etc. A platform engineer often writes automation (scripts, Terraform code, Kubernetes manifests) to provision and configure these tools as reusable services ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=Platform%20engineers%20bring%20the%20necessary,functional%20requirements)).
- **Developing Self-Service Interfaces:** Critically, they create **easy interfaces** for developers to consume infrastructure. This could mean developing a web portal, CLI, or APIs that developers use to request resources (databases, environments, etc.) without filing tickets ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=platform%20team%20takes%20all%20these,secure%20up%20to%20date%20etc)).
- **Standardization and Updates:** Platform teams maintain **standards and best practices**. They ensure tools are kept up-to-date and consistent. For instance, if a new version of Kubernetes or Jenkins is released, the platform team tests and rolls it out for everyone, rather than each squad figuring it out on their own.
- **Developer Support & Onboarding:** They often act as a support team for developers, helping them use the platform effectively. They might document how to deploy an app on the internal platform, or assist teams in migrating onto new tooling.
- **Ensuring Non-Functional Goals:** As noted, platform engineers are custodians of non-functional requirements. They set up frameworks for logging, alerting, backups, compliance checks, etc., so that every product automatically meets the organization’s reliability and security benchmarks ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=A%20platform%20engineer%E2%80%99s%20responsibilities%20are,to%20automate%20cloud%20resources)).

Overall, you can think of the platform engineering team as running an **internal “product” (the platform)** that serves the developers as its customers. Their product is the development platform that makes software delivery easier for everyone else. In fact, industry experts often say a good platform team adopts a *product mindset* – treating developers as users whose experience and feedback matter, and iterating on the platform to meet their needs.

## How Platform Engineering Works: Introducing IDPs

One of the most important concepts in platform engineering is the **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**. An IDP is essentially the culmination of the platform team’s work – it’s the *self-service platform* that developers actually interact with. Think of it as a private, in-house version of a cloud platform or Platform-as-a-Service, tailored specifically to your organization. 

 ([Basics of Platform Engineering & Internal Developer Platforms](https://www.buildpiper.io/blogs/platform-engineering-and-internal-developer-platforms/)) *Platform engineers build and manage an **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)** – a layer that sits between developers and the underlying infrastructure. Developers use the IDP via self-service interfaces, while the platform team maintains the tools and services behind it. This allows dev teams to request and utilize infrastructure or services on-demand without manual intervention, streamlining the software delivery process.* 

In practical terms, a well-designed IDP provides an **abstraction layer** over infrastructure. The platform team takes all the complex tools (cloud services, Kubernetes clusters, databases, etc.) that application teams need and sets them up correctly – secured, configured, and integrated ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=platform%20team%20takes%20all%20these,secure%20up%20to%20date%20etc)). They then expose these capabilities through a *user-friendly interface* such as a web portal, CLI, or API. This lets developers obtain what they need with a few clicks or commands. For example, if a developer requires a new testing environment or wants to deploy a microservice, they could log in to the internal platform portal and launch one themselves, rather than opening a support ticket. Because everything under the hood is pre-configured by the platform team, these self-service actions are safe and compliant by default.

Importantly, with an IDP, developers **don’t have to wait** on the platform engineers for each request – self-service is key. Once the platform is in place, devs can help themselves to common resources (like creating a database instance, or deploying via an approved pipeline) whenever they need ([From DevOps to the Future: The Evolutionary Leap to Platform Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-devops-future-evolutionary-leap-platform-rajith-kumar#:~:text=Then%20they%20create%20an%20abstraction,kind%20of%20platform%20as%20Service)). This avoids slipping back into the slow, centralized IT processes of the past. It’s a balance: the platform team centralizes the creation of the platform *itself*, but decentralizes its use to the developers. In essence, an IDP is a form of internal PaaS (Platform as a Service) – sometimes described as providing “**golden paths**” for developers to get their work done using standard, supported methods.

## A Real-World Example of an Internal Platform

To visualize an Internal Developer Platform, consider a real-world example. **Spotify’s Backstage** is a well-known internal developer portal that was developed at Spotify and later open-sourced. Backstage serves as a unified interface for Spotify’s engineers to access all kinds of development tools and resources ([ Platform engineering with Spotify's Backstage - integrating demo application for basic functionality](https://codilime.com/blog/spotify-backstage-for-platform-engineering/#:~:text=Spotify%20Backstage%20is%20an%20open,engineering%20domain%2C%20you%20can%20read)). Through Backstage, a developer at Spotify can do things like create a new microservice from a standard template, find documentation and metadata for services, provision infrastructure, or check the health of their deployments – all from one central hub. In essence, *Backstage is a key part of Spotify’s internal platform engineering effort, aimed at enhancing developer productivity by offering a single pane of glass for the engineering ecosystem* ([ Platform engineering with Spotify's Backstage - integrating demo application for basic functionality](https://codilime.com/blog/spotify-backstage-for-platform-engineering/#:~:text=Spotify%20Backstage%20is%20an%20open,management%20of%20Spotify%27s%20complex%20engineering)).

Many other tech-forward companies have built similar internal platforms. For instance, Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix have platform teams that provide internal tooling and portals to their developers (though the specifics are often proprietary). The common theme is that these platforms **streamline day-to-day workflows**. A developer might need a new database for a feature – instead of manually configuring one or coordinating with an ops specialist, they go to the internal platform’s interface and request a managed database, which the platform provisions automatically. Or if a team wants to deploy a service, they use the standardized pipeline from the platform, which ensures logging, monitoring, and rollbacks are all handled in a consistent way. This results in faster, more reliable delivery. Studies have found that organizations with internal developer platforms can take ideas to production much faster, because they minimize the repetitive grunt work and reinvention across teams ([The business impact of Internal Developer Platforms for improved ROI | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/12/21/the-business-impact-of-internal-developer-platforms-for-improved-roi/#:~:text=IDPs%20minimize%20duplicate%20work%20across,conception%20to%20launch%20much%20faster)) ([The business impact of Internal Developer Platforms for improved ROI | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/12/21/the-business-impact-of-internal-developer-platforms-for-improved-roi/#:~:text=The%20same%20survey%20also%20found,usage%20of%20internal%20developer%20platforms)).

It’s worth noting that an IDP doesn’t have to be one monolithic tool – it can be a collection of integrated services. What matters is the **developer experience**: from a developer’s perspective, the platform feels like a coherent product that abstracts away infrastructure complexity. In the real world, companies might use a combination of open-source projects and custom code to build their IDP. For example, a platform team could combine a service catalog (like Backstage), an infrastructure orchestration engine, and various automation scripts to create a seamless portal. The ultimate goal is to let developers concentrate on coding features, while the platform handles the rest.

## Infrastructure as Code: Ensuring Flexibility

One concern teams might have when adopting a centralized platform is: will we lose flexibility? The answer, when done right, is no – thanks in part to practices like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. In fact, infrastructure as code is a foundational element of most internal platforms. Platform engineers leverage IaC tools (such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Helm charts, etc.) to define the infrastructure and configurations in a programmable way ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=operations%20teams%20and%20a%20commitment,cloud%20environments%2C%20and%20automation%20tools)) ([Platform Engineering vs. Cloud Engineering - NashTech Blog](https://blog.nashtechglobal.com/platform-engineering-vs-cloud-engineering/#:~:text=)). This provides consistency and repeatability across environments, and it means the platform can be treated as version-controlled code itself.

By using IaC, the platform can be rapidly changed or extended as needs evolve. If a new service or resource type needs to be offered through the IDP, the platform team can update their IaC templates or modules and roll it out organization-wide. IaC also makes it easier to enforce standards (since all deployments use the same code templates) while still allowing parameterization for different teams or applications. Essentially, it brings the **same agility of cloud provisioning to the internal platform**. Teams get the benefits of abstraction without being locked into static configurations – everything is defined in code and can be modified when necessary (with proper review and testing by the platform maintainers).

It’s also common that platform engineering teams encourage or enable developers to use IaC for any custom infrastructure needs beyond what the IDP directly provides. For example, if a development team has a very unique requirement, they might work with the platform team to write new Terraform modules or Kubernetes configurations. In this way, **platform engineering and Infrastructure as Code go hand-in-hand** to strike a balance between **standardization and flexibility**. The platform provides approved patterns and modules (the golden paths), but because those are built on IaC, they can evolve and developers can contribute to them if needed. This approach prevents the internal platform from becoming a rigid bottleneck; instead it remains an evolving, agile product.

## Implementing an Internal Developer Platform Successfully

Building an internal platform is not a trivial project – it requires careful planning and iteration. Many organizations have learned lessons on what it takes to **implement an IDP successfully**. Here are some key considerations and best practices:

- **Start with Clear Goals and Use Cases:** Before writing any code, clarify what problems you expect the IDP to solve. Identify the biggest pain points for your developers (e.g. “onboarding a new service takes too long” or “environments are inconsistent”). The platform should target those issues. Having specific objectives tied to business outcomes will guide the design and also help get buy-in ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=of%20time%20and%20resources%20needed,to%20continuously%20iterate%20and%20improve)). In short, **treat the IDP as a product** and define its value proposition – avoid creating a platform “in search of a problem.”
- **Secure Leadership Support:** An internal platform often requires significant upfront investment in time and talent. It’s crucial to have management and leadership understanding the long-term benefits. Executive support can allocate the necessary resources (and patience) to build the platform right ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=and%20maintain%20an%20IDP,in%20search%20of%20a%20problem)). Without this, a platform initiative might fizzle out if it doesn’t deliver instant ROI. Communicate how the IDP will ultimately speed up delivery, improve quality, and reduce costs (for instance, by saving each team from duplicate infrastructure work).
- **Build the Right Team and Embrace DevOps Culture:** The platform engineering team should consist of skilled individuals who understand both development and operations. They’ll need expertise in cloud infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and possibly in product management (to interface with developer “customers”) ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=3,needed%20for%20its%20successful%20deployment)) ([An Overview Of Platform Engineering | by DevopsCurry (DC) | Medium](https://devopscurry.medium.com/an-overview-of-platform-engineering-3433e4328711#:~:text=A%20platform%20engineer%E2%80%99s%20responsibilities%20are,to%20automate%20cloud%20resources)). Additionally, ensure your organization has a DevOps-friendly culture because platform engineering extends DevOps principles. Collaboration between platform engineers and application developers is essential – the platform team must regularly gather feedback from developers to iterate on the IDP. A culture of cooperation and continuous improvement will make the IDP much more likely to succeed.
- **Standardize Tech Stack (but Stay Flexible):** It helps to have a relatively well-defined set of technologies in use (programming languages, cloud provider, etc.) when building the platform ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=1.%20Well,IaC%20as%20it%20forms%20the)). If every team uses completely different tech, the IDP may become too broad or unfocused. Identify common denominators to support first (for example, if 80% of services are run on Kubernetes, start by centering the platform on Kubernetes). That said, design the platform in a modular way so you can **extend support** to more tools or frameworks over time. The initial version should nail the basics that benefit most teams.
- **Take an Iterative Approach:** Don’t try to build the “perfect” platform in one go. Successful internal platforms often start small – perhaps automating one or two painful tasks – and then expand. **Iterate based on user feedback** ([Signs Your Team Needs an Internal Developer Platform](https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/when-to-build-an-internal-developer-platform#:~:text=problem,the%20most%20from%20your%20IDP)). Treat your developers as customers: release early versions of the platform, let teams try it, and listen to what works or what they need next. This agile approach prevents wasting effort on features that users don’t want or complicated systems that are hard to maintain. Over time, the IDP can evolve to cover more scenarios once you have proven value in initial areas.
- **Measure and Communicate Success:** Track metrics that demonstrate the platform’s impact – for instance, reduced lead time for changes, fewer support tickets, faster onboarding of new engineers, or percentage of deployments going through the IDP vs. ad-hoc. Sharing these wins helps maintain support for the project and can encourage more teams to adopt the platform. It also helps identify where to focus next (e.g. if deployment speed improved but developers still struggle with test data setup, maybe the platform should tackle that).

By following principles like these, organizations increase the odds that their internal developer platform delivers on its promise. There are also pitfalls to avoid – for example, not involving developers in the design (leading to a platform nobody wants), or underestimating the ongoing maintenance required (an IDP is a living product, not a one-time install). But when done right, a well-implemented IDP can dramatically boost engineering efficiency and developer happiness by freeing teams from “undifferentiated heavy lifting” and letting them concentrate on building features.

## Platform Engineering vs. DevOps

Does platform engineering mean the end of DevOps? In a word: **no.** In fact, platform engineering can be seen as an evolution or specialization of DevOps, not a replacement ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Platform%20engineering%20is%20a%20hot,core%20philosophies%20that%20underpin%20DevOps)). DevOps is fundamentally a culture and set of practices aimed at breaking down silos between development and operations, emphasizing automation, collaboration, and shared responsibility for delivering software. Platform engineering fully embraces those same goals – it just tackles some of the practical challenges that arise as DevOps matures in large organizations. 

Notably, **platform engineering is not “DevOps minus ops” or anything like that; it’s DevOps taken to a higher level of scale**. A quote from a Pluralsight article encapsulated it well: *Platform engineering isn’t the DevOps killer – it’s built upon the core philosophies that underpin DevOps, representing the next progression in delivering modern infrastructure* ([Platform Engineering: A DevOps evolution, not a replacement](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/business-and-leadership/platform-engineering-devops-difference-explained#:~:text=Platform%20engineering%20is%20a%20hot,core%20philosophies%20that%20underpin%20DevOps)). In other words, platform engineering extends the DevOps approach by adding a structured way to provide **standardized tools, environments, and workflows** to developers ([Platform engineering vs. DevOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/platform-engineering-vs-devops#:~:text=Platform%20engineering%20extends%20DevOps%20practices,Platform%20engineering%20has%20grown)). It acknowledges that as companies grow, simply telling every product team “you build it, you run it” can lead to duplicated effort and overload, so a **DevOps-oriented platform team** is created to support those product teams.

In practice, many companies use the terms and roles interchangeably or in combination. A skilled “DevOps engineer” might end up working on the platform team, or a “platform engineer” might have very similar skillsets to a senior DevOps practitioner. The difference is one of **focus and scope** rather than philosophy. DevOps as a broad concept continues to be about culture change and cross-functional work. Platform engineering zooms in on how to **operationalize that culture across an organization** by building enabling technology. One industry survey found that 93% of tech professionals believe having a platform team is a step in the right direction – indicating that platform engineering is viewed as a way to make DevOps initiatives more successful, not to abolish them ([Platform Engineering | DEVOPSdigest](https://www.devopsdigest.com/hot-topic/platform-engineering#:~:text=Platform%20engineering%20is%20rising%20in,from%20Puppet%20by%20Perforce)).

It’s also worth noting that platform engineering does **not eliminate the need for operations or SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)**. Those roles still play a crucial part, especially in production reliability and responding to incidents. Platform teams often work closely with SRE teams – the platform provides the tooling, and SREs use it to ensure systems are running smoothly. In many cases, platform engineering can free up SREs and ops engineers from routine tasks by automating them in the IDP, allowing them to focus on higher-level reliability work. So rather than “DevOps vs. platform engineering,” it’s more accurate to think “DevOps **and** platform engineering.” The two together help organizations deliver software faster and more reliably by combining cultural practices with supporting infrastructure.

## Platform Engineer vs. Cloud Engineer

Another common question is how platform engineers differ from **cloud engineers** or infrastructure engineers. At a glance these roles might seem similar – and indeed they do overlap – but there are distinctions in focus:

A **cloud engineer** (or cloud infrastructure engineer) typically concentrates on designing and managing the low-level cloud environment. They are often experts in a specific cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) and focus on things like setting up cloud architectures (networks, VM instances, managed services), optimizing cost and performance of cloud resources, and ensuring cloud security and compliance ([DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineer vs Cloud Roles](https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-sre-vs-platform-engineer-vs-cloud-engine#:~:text=Cloud%20Engineer)) ([DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineer vs Cloud Roles](https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-sre-vs-platform-engineer-vs-cloud-engine#:~:text=Platform%20Engineer%20roles%20are%20like,smooth%20experience%20for%20everyone%20involved)). Cloud engineers build the foundation in the cloud that applications run on, acting like “cloud architects” who provision infrastructure as needed for various teams ([DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineer vs Cloud Roles](https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-sre-vs-platform-engineer-vs-cloud-engine#:~:text=Cloud%20Engineer)).

A **platform engineer**, on the other hand, works at a layer above that. As discussed, platform engineers **create the developer-friendly platforms and toolchains** that sit on top of the raw infrastructure ([DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineer vs Cloud Roles](https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-sre-vs-platform-engineer-vs-cloud-engine#:~:text=Platform%20Engineer)). Their knowledge spans a wider range of tools beyond just the cloud itself – including CI/CD systems, container orchestration (like Kubernetes), service mesh, observability tools, etc. In essence, if a cloud engineer builds the kitchen (the cloud infrastructure), the platform engineer assembles the appliances, utensils, and recipe book that allow the chefs (developers) to effectively cook in that kitchen ([DevOps vs. Cloud vs. Platform Engineer | Difference - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ibrahimsi/devops-vs-cloud-vs-platform-engineer-difference-2455#:~:text=DevOps%20vs,Platform%20Engineer%3A%20The%20inventor)). The platform engineer’s goal is to empower developers with easy-to-use capabilities, whereas the cloud engineer’s goal is to provide a robust, efficient cloud environment.

In practice, these roles work **very closely together**. Platform engineering and cloud engineering are “intricately connected and collaborate to optimize modern infrastructure,” as one industry blog noted ([Platform Engineering vs. Cloud Engineering - NashTech Blog](https://blog.nashtechglobal.com/platform-engineering-vs-cloud-engineering/#:~:text=)). Platform engineers often rely on cloud engineers to provide a stable foundation of cloud services and to handle deep cloud-specific issues. Cloud engineers benefit from platform engineers who build higher-level abstractions that make using the cloud simpler for developers ([Platform Engineering vs. Cloud Engineering - NashTech Blog](https://blog.nashtechglobal.com/platform-engineering-vs-cloud-engineering/#:~:text=While%20platform%20engineering%20and%20cloud,foundations%20built%20by%20platform%20engineers)). In a large organization, you might have a cloud team ensuring the AWS/Azure environment is in order (VPCs, accounts, networking, etc.), and a platform team building an IDP on top of that cloud – for example, offering templated environments, deployment pipelines, and centralized logging for all applications. 

In smaller companies, the same person or team might wear both hats, doing a bit of cloud setup and a bit of platform building. But conceptually, remember: **cloud engineering = expert in cloud infrastructure**, **platform engineering = builds internal tools and platforms for devs** ([Interview Roadmap for SRE, DevOps, Platform Engineer, Cloud ...](https://bgiri-gcloud.medium.com/interview-roadmap-for-sre-devops-platform-engineer-cloud-engineer-and-cloud-infrastructure-e877a871716e#:~:text=Interview%20Roadmap%20for%20SRE%2C%20DevOps%2C,and%20Cloud%20Infrastructure%20Engineer%20Roles)) ([DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineer vs Cloud Roles](https://dzone.com/articles/devops-vs-sre-vs-platform-engineer-vs-cloud-engine#:~:text=Platform%20Engineer)). A cloud engineer ensures the **infrastructure is available and scalable**, a platform engineer ensures the **developers can use that infrastructure easily and productively**. Both roles are complementary in implementing a successful DevOps strategy.

## Conclusion: The Road Ahead

Platform engineering has quickly moved from a buzzword to a practical reality in many organizations, precisely because it addresses real challenges that modern DevOps teams face. By establishing a dedicated function to create an Internal Developer Platform, companies can standardize their tool usage, reduce cognitive load on developers, and attain greater consistency in how software is built and run. Crucially, this doesn’t upend the principles of DevOps – it builds upon them. The platform team provides the shared services and golden paths that enable development teams to practice DevOps at scale, with less friction.

As we’ve seen, platform engineering touches many areas: from choosing technologies and enforcing non-functional requirements, to fostering self-service and collaborating with cloud experts. It requires a mix of technical acumen and product thinking. Done well, it results in happier developers (who spend more time writing code and less time fighting infrastructure) and faster delivery cycles for the business ([The business impact of Internal Developer Platforms for improved ROI | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/12/21/the-business-impact-of-internal-developer-platforms-for-improved-roi/#:~:text=IDPs%20minimize%20duplicate%20work%20across,conception%20to%20launch%20much%20faster)) ([The business impact of Internal Developer Platforms for improved ROI | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/12/21/the-business-impact-of-internal-developer-platforms-for-improved-roi/#:~:text=The%20same%20survey%20also%20found,usage%20of%20internal%20developer%20platforms)). In an era of complex cloud-native systems, platform engineering offers a way to **restore simplicity without sacrificing flexibility** – allowing innovation to happen on top of a reliable, efficient base.

Moving forward, we can expect platform engineering to further mature. Industry surveys already show a strong trend of adoption, with a large majority of organizations either implementing or planning internal platforms ([Platform Engineering | DEVOPSdigest](https://www.devopsdigest.com/hot-topic/platform-engineering#:~:text=Platform%20engineering%20is%20rising%20in,from%20Puppet%20by%20Perforce)). As success stories spread, best practices (and maybe industry standards) for team structure and IDP design will solidify. It’s likely that **platform engineer** will become as standard a role as “DevOps engineer” did in the previous decade – and many professionals will skill up in both domains. In the end, what matters is delivering value quickly to end-users. Platform engineering is proving to be a powerful approach to help DevOps teams do just that, by enabling software developers and easing the ops burdens behind the scenes. It’s an evolution, not a revolution, and one that is poised to play an increasingly important role in the software development lifecycle. 



# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) in Software Development

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) play a critical role in software development by defining the **quality attributes** and operational characteristics of a system. Unlike functional requirements, which specify what the system should do, NFRs focus on how the system performs and how well it meets expectations under various conditions.

### Why Non-Functional Requirements Matter

In any complex software system, ignoring NFRs can lead to:
1. **Performance Bottlenecks** - Systems that slow down under heavy load.
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Software that is susceptible to data breaches.
3. **Poor User Experience** - Applications that are slow or unresponsive.
4. **Operational Challenges** - Difficulty in maintaining or scaling the system.
5. **Compliance Issues** - Failure to meet legal or industry standards.

Implementing NFRs effectively ensures that the system is **robust, secure, and maintainable**. Let’s break down the various types of NFRs and discuss why each is important and how to adopt them effectively.
