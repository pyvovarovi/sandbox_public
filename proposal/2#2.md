data consolidation

| **Deviation Level** | **Example Scenario for Data Consolidation** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Low**             | *Minor data format inconsistencies:* Some non-critical datasets occasionally use a different date or numeric format that your automated normalization scripts can easily correct. This results in a negligible delay or minor manual adjustment, but overall data consolidation remains robust. |
| **Moderate**        | *Inconsistent schema or naming conventions:* A few data sources use slightly different field names or data structures (e.g., “Customer_ID” vs. “Client_ID”) that require additional mapping. This leads to sporadic data duplication or misalignment, necessitating periodic manual reconciliation to maintain accurate consolidated reports. |
| **High**            | *Systemic integration gaps:* Critical data sources are not fully integrated due to substantial differences in data formats or schema standards. For example, one key system stores transactional data in a legacy format incompatible with modern consolidation tools, leading to incomplete datasets and unreliable business metrics until significant remediation is applied. |
| **Critical**        | *Fragmented consolidation architecture:* The overall architecture is so misaligned that essential data is entirely omitted from the consolidated system. This might occur if multiple major data sources are using disparate systems with no standardization or synchronization process. The resulting gaps in data not only impair reporting and decision-making but may also breach compliance requirements, demanding immediate and comprehensive remediation. |
