|----------|---------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy** | - Does the current migration plan fully align with our technology roadmap? (e.g., cloud‑first approach adhered) <br> - Are deviations minor, affecting only non‑critical configurations? (e.g., slight UI customization) <br> - Can standard procedures address these differences?

(e.g., phased corrective actions) | - What core components of the migration are significantly misaligned with our strategy?

(e.g., loss of competitive advantage) <br> - What corrective actions are proposed to re‑align critical elements? (e.g., strategic re‑assessment sessions) | - Which critical strategic elements are entirely bypassed by the current plan? (e.g., major security or performance standards neglected) <br> - What immediate risks to business continuity have been identified? (e.g., substantial operational gaps) <br> - What urgent measures are required to remediate these misalignments? (e.g., complete process overhaul) |

(e.g., increased integration complexity) <br> - Are there plans to mitigate these deviations? (e.g., scheduled refactoring) | - Which core architectural standards are significantly breached? (e.g., non‑compliance with security protocols) <br> - How might these breaches affect overall system reliability? (e.g., potential performance bottlenecks) <br> - What redesign efforts are needed to address these deviations?

(e.g., immediate process suspension until resolved) |
| **Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture** | - Does the current solution meet most target state criteria? (e.g., near‑full alignment with cloud architecture) <br> - Are discrepancies minimal and non‑disruptive? (e.g., slight variance in data modeling) <br> - Can these gaps be resolved in upcoming phases? (e.g., planned iterative improvements) | - What specific gaps exist between the current state and the target state?

(e.g., core policies intact) | - Which specific policies show moderate deviations? (e.g., data handling procedures) <br> - How might these deviations affect audit and compliance outcomes? (e.g., moderate audit findings) <br> - What remediation steps are planned? (e.g., updated training or process tweaks) | - What high‑impact policy violations are evident?

(e.g., failure to adhere to mandatory security protocols) <br> - What immediate regulatory risks exist? (e.g., potential legal actions or fines) <br> - What emergency measures must be implemented? (e.g., operational suspension until resolved) |
| **IT Technology Dependency** | - Is dependency on external or legacy systems minimal? (e.g., reliance on internal solutions) <br> - Are risks from external dependencies negligible? (e.g., no single vendor lock‑in) <br> - Can standard risk management practices address these dependencies? (e.g., existing backups suffice) | - Which external technologies show moderate dependency? (e.g., reliance on third‑party APIs) <br> - How might this dependency affect project timelines? (e.g., moderate risk of delays) <br> - What contingency plans are in place? (e.g., dual sourcing strategies) | - What key operations are highly dependent on external systems? (e.g., mission‑critical services tied to one vendor) <br> - How does this elevate operational risks? (e.g., potential service outages) <br> - What mitigation strategies are proposed? (e.g., vendor diversification or in‑house alternatives) | - Which operations are critically dependent on external/legacy technology? (e.g., single point of failure) <br> - What are the immediate risks to service continuity? (e.g., catastrophic disruption risk) <br> - What urgent actions are required to reduce this dependency? (e.g., immediate vendor diversification) |
