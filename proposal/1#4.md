Below is a structured approach to framing and justifying architecture‐related policy violation levels in your migration and integration scenario. This document is organized into sections that provide context, define each violation level, and list targeted questions and examples that you can use when discussing these issues with the business owner.

## 1. Project Context

**Scenario Overview:**  
- **Database Migration:** The migration involves moving existing on-premises tables to a cloud environment with Snowflake as the target.
- **Phased Approach:** Not all tables are migrated in a single process; some will be available as local copies via a secondary migration process.
- **Integration Considerations:** The strategy must address data consistency, performance impacts, and integration complexities between the main cloud migration and the local copies.

## 2. Architecture-Related Policy Violation Levels

Each level of violation is defined by the severity of deviation from the established architectural policies. Below are detailed questions and examples for each level.

### **A. Low Violation**

**Definition:**  
Minor deviations with negligible impact on overall system performance and data integrity. These issues often represent small misalignments that can be remediated in the routine maintenance cycle.

**Questions for the Business Owner:**  
- *Scope & Impact:*  
  - “What minor deviations have we observed that do not directly impact critical system functionality?”
  - “Are there any known discrepancies, such as naming convention inconsistencies or minor schema differences, that can be tolerated in the short term?”
- *Mitigation & Monitoring:*  
  - “How can we monitor these minor issues to ensure they do not evolve into larger concerns?”
  - “What are our current thresholds for accepting small variations in the migration process?”

**Example:**  
- A table’s column naming slightly differs between the legacy system and the Snowflake copy. The variation does not affect query results or performance but should be documented and standardized over time.

### **B. Moderate Violation**

**Definition:**  
Issues that have a noticeable impact on operations but remain manageable with planned remediation. These deviations might affect performance or data consistency in a controlled manner if left unaddressed.

**Questions for the Business Owner:**  
- *Process Gaps & Operational Impact:*  
  - “Which specific areas in the migration process are not aligning with our target architecture?”
  - “How do these discrepancies affect our reporting or data consistency across integrated systems?”
- *Resolution Strategy:*  
  - “What interim measures or workarounds can be implemented until full migration is achieved?”
  - “Are there any temporary performance or security impacts that need prioritization?”

**Example:**  
- Some tables available as local copies have indexing strategies that differ from their cloud counterparts, potentially leading to query performance variations. This issue is moderate because it may affect performance under load but does not immediately compromise data integrity.

---

### **C. High Violation**

**Definition:**  
Significant deviations that could compromise system reliability, performance, or data integrity. These violations require prompt attention to ensure the system meets business-critical requirements.

**Questions for the Business Owner:**  
- *Critical Process Disruptions:*  
  - “What is the extent of the impact on system performance and data integrity due to these architectural deviations?”
  - “How do these violations affect the integration between the local copies and the primary cloud data in Snowflake?”
- *Risk & Remediation Timeline:*  
  - “What is the estimated timeline for addressing these significant deviations?”
  - “How will we prioritize remediation actions to minimize disruption to business operations?”

**Example:**  
- An incomplete data transformation process is causing inconsistencies between the source and cloud copies, leading to inaccurate reporting and potential operational bottlenecks. This gap is high because it directly affects the reliability of critical business data.

---

### **D. Critical Violation**

**Definition:**  
Severe issues that pose immediate risks to business operations, compliance, security, or data integrity. These violations demand urgent remediation to prevent significant adverse outcomes.

**Questions for the Business Owner:**  
- *Immediate Risk Assessment:*  
  - “Does the current deviation expose the system to immediate risks such as security breaches or data loss?”
  - “What are the potential financial, legal, or reputational consequences if these issues are not addressed immediately?”
- *Emergency Response & Escalation:*  
  - “What emergency mitigation measures are in place to address this critical violation?”
  - “How is the escalation plan structured to ensure that a critical issue is resolved with top priority?”

**Example:**  
- A critical integration flaw leads to a failure in data synchronization between the local copies and the Snowflake environment, which in turn causes discrepancies in financial reporting and could violate regulatory compliance requirements. This scenario is deemed critical due to its immediate and far-reaching impact on business operations.

## 3. Refinement and Expansion Considerations

- **Documentation:**  
  - Clearly document the nature of each deviation and its associated risk level.
  - Use visual aids (e.g., process flow diagrams, impact analysis charts) to illustrate where each issue occurs in the migration pipeline.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Schedule regular review meetings with business owners to reassess risk levels and update remediation plans.
  - Develop dashboards or metrics that reflect real-time progress and highlight areas that require immediate attention.

- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Incorporate lessons learned from each migration phase to refine the overall architecture policy.
  - Update risk assessment frameworks based on observed deviations and emerging best practices.

By addressing these questions and using concrete examples, you can guide the business owner to understand the severity of each policy violation level and align remediation efforts with overall business goals and compliance requirements.
