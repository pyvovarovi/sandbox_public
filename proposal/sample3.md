Below is a structured and refined approach for evaluating the cloud migration scenario against six key dimensions. The table is organized with severity levels (Low, Moderate, High, Critical) as columns and the evaluation types as rows. In each cell, you’ll find sample questions and examples you can pose to the business owner to help justify and clarify the level of deviation or impact.

### Context Overview

**Scenario:**  
A database migration and integration project is underway to move to the cloud. Not all tables are migrated in the first round; some tables are available as local copies through a secondary process. Ultimately, all tables will reside in Snowflake.

**Evaluation Dimensions:**  
1. **Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy**  
2. **Deviation from Divisional Architecture Principles**  
3. **Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture**  
4. **Architecture-Related Policy Violation**  
5. **IT Technology Dependency**  
6. **Economic Impact, Internal Technology Investment**

Each dimension is assessed using four levels of severity: **Low, Moderate, High,** and **Critical**. The questions and examples provided help the business owner understand the impact and justify the classification.

### Evaluation Table

| **Evaluation Type** | **Low** | **Moderate** | **High** | **Critical** |
|---------------------|---------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **1. Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy** | - **Question:** Does the current migration approach align with the outlined strategy with only minor adjustments?<br> - **Example:** Local copy approach fits within the strategy when only minimal deviations are present. | - **Question:** What specific aspects of the migration deviate from our established technology strategy?<br> - **Example:** Not migrating all tables in one go may require extra alignment steps with the strategy. | - **Question:** How do these deviations affect our strategic technology roadmap and what compensatory measures are planned?<br> - **Example:** Significant portions of data remain as local copies, risking misalignment with the overall strategy. | - **Question:** Do these deviations compromise our strategic objectives, and what is the mitigation plan?<br> - **Example:** A fundamental misalignment with the strategic direction that may require a complete reassessment of the cloud integration approach. |
| **2. Deviation from Divisional Architecture Principles** | - **Question:** Are our migration processes in line with our core architecture principles, with only minor exceptions?<br> - **Example:** Most tables adhere to standard architectural practices with negligible deviation. | - **Question:** Which specific architectural principles are not fully adhered to in this migration?<br> - **Example:** Certain tables may not fully conform to our established data modeling guidelines. | - **Question:** What significant breaches of our architecture principles are evident and how will they be remediated?<br> - **Example:** Key data structures deviate from design standards, potentially affecting system integration. | - **Question:** Could these violations of core architectural principles jeopardize system integrity?<br> - **Example:** Critical non-compliance in key areas might lead to security risks or operational failures. |
| **3. Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture** | - **Question:** Does the current state closely mirror our target state architecture with only minor discrepancies?<br> - **Example:** Most components align well; any deviations are within acceptable limits. | - **Question:** Which elements of the target state are currently unmet, and what is our plan to achieve full alignment?<br> - **Example:** Some tables are only available as local copies, delaying complete integration. | - **Question:** How significant is the divergence between the current state and the target state, and what are the operational implications?<br> - **Example:** Major components are misaligned, indicating a delay in reaching the target architecture. | - **Question:** Does the current architecture fundamentally fail to meet target state requirements, necessitating an urgent redesign?<br> - **Example:** Extensive misalignment that could force a major rework of our integration approach. |
| **4. Architecture-Related Policy Violation** | - **Question:** Are there minor policy deviations that can be quickly rectified without major impact?<br> - **Example:** Small documentation or process gaps that are easily addressable. | - **Question:** What specific policy violations have been identified, and what is their potential impact on compliance?<br> - **Example:** Some security policies may be loosely enforced during the local copy migration process. | - **Question:** How do these policy violations increase risk exposure, and what are our remediation plans?<br> - **Example:** Multiple instances of non-compliance that could expose the system to operational risks. | - **Question:** Do these policy breaches represent a significant risk to our compliance posture and operational security, warranting immediate corrective action?<br> - **Example:** Severe breaches that could lead to regulatory penalties or critical security vulnerabilities. |
| **5. IT Technology Dependency** | - **Question:** Are our technology dependencies minimal and well-supported by existing solutions?<br> - **Example:** Limited reliance on non-standard technologies with clear support channels. | - **Question:** What moderate dependencies exist that might need risk mitigation strategies?<br> - **Example:** Some dependency on legacy processes that could affect scalability. | - **Question:** Which high-level dependencies might impede future scalability or introduce risk into our integration?<br> - **Example:** Heavy reliance on outdated middleware may complicate future enhancements. | - **Question:** Are there critical dependencies that threaten long-term system viability or require immediate replacement?<br> - **Example:** Over-dependence on unsupported technologies that pose a risk to operational continuity. |
| **6. Economic Impact, Internal Technology Investment** | - **Question:** Is the economic impact of this migration minimal and within the forecasted investment levels?<br> - **Example:** Costs are on target and investment returns are as expected. | - **Question:** What moderate financial risks have emerged from deviations in the migration plan?<br> - **Example:** Additional investments may be required to align local copies with the target state architecture. | - **Question:** How significant are the financial deviations from our planned investment, and what impact will this have on ROI?<br> - **Example:** Higher than expected costs due to rework or integration complexities could affect budget forecasts. | - **Question:** Are the economic implications of the current approach unsustainable, potentially jeopardizing our overall technology investment strategy?<br> - **Example:** Critical cost overruns that require immediate budgetary reassessment and potential strategic realignment. |

### Next Steps and Considerations

1. **Review Each Dimension:**  
   Engage with the business owner using the questions in each cell to gain clarity on how the current migration approach aligns with strategic, architectural, and economic objectives.

2. **Gather Supporting Evidence:**  
   Use documented project data, risk assessments, and cost forecasts to validate the level chosen. This ensures that deviations or dependencies are quantified.

3. **Prioritize Remediation:**  
   For any areas rated **High** or **Critical**, develop a detailed action plan. This may include additional investments, revised migration strategies, or a re-alignment of project scope.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**  
   Establish checkpoints to monitor the evolution of these factors throughout the migration process, ensuring that adjustments are made proactively as project conditions evolve.

This table and the follow-up steps form a comprehensive framework for discussing and assessing the project’s current status with the business owner. It facilitates targeted questioning and helps in aligning the migration with the divisional objectives and risk tolerance levels.
