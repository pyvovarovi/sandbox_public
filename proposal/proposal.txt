1. Low Deviation (Minor impact, aligns with strategy)
Scenario:

A company is migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL.
Most tables are migrated, but some small lookup/reference tables are kept locally in an application’s embedded SQLite database for faster access.
These local copies are read-only and synchronized periodically from the PostgreSQL database.
Justification:

No impact on data integrity or system performance.
The approach is within best practices and doesn’t introduce complexity.
Example:

Keeping a local copy of a "Country Codes" table in an application database for quick lookups while the primary data resides in PostgreSQL

2. Moderate Deviation (Some risks, but manageable)
Scenario:

Migrating from Sybase ASE to Microsoft SQL Server.
Most transactional tables are migrated, but a subset of reporting tables is retained in Sybase for legacy applications.
An ETL job refreshes the SQL Server data, but reports generated from Sybase may have slight delays.
Justification:

Some data latency risks, but acceptable for non-real-time reporting.
Requires additional maintenance for synchronization.
Example:

Keeping historical sales reports in Sybase while migrating real-time sales transactions to SQL Server.
3. High Deviation (Significant risk, requires strong justification)
Scenario:

Migrating from DB2 to MySQL for cost efficiency.
Key operational tables are migrated, but some financial transaction tables remain in DB2 due to third-party integrations.
Multiple complex data movement scripts are required to ensure consistency.
Justification:

Increased complexity and operational overhead.
Higher risk of data inconsistency between databases.
Might cause issues in reconciliation and reporting.
Example:

Keeping invoices and payment transactions in DB2 while migrating customer and order data to MySQL, leading to complex joins across databases.
4. Critical Deviation (Severe misalignment, strong risk)
Scenario:

Migrating from SAP HANA to PostgreSQL, but only a small subset of tables is moved.
The majority of business-critical tables (e.g., customer, orders, payments) remain in SAP HANA with no structured synchronization process.
Applications must query both databases separately, leading to fragmented data access and poor performance.
Justification:

High operational risk due to lack of integration.
No clear data governance strategy.
Increased technical debt, making future migrations difficult.
Example:

Migrating only customer profile data to PostgreSQL while keeping order and transaction history in SAP HANA, making it impossible to generate unified reports without multiple manual queries.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
1. Low Deviation (Minor impact, aligns with strategy)
Scenario:

A company is migrating from Oracle (hosted in AWS RDS) to Snowflake.
Most tables are migrated to Snowflake, but some lookup/reference tables are kept as local copies in an Azure SQL Database for a specific reporting tool that is not yet connected to Snowflake.
These tables are small, read-only, and synchronized nightly.
Justification:

No major impact on performance, security, or maintainability.
Temporary workaround that aligns with the long-term migration plan.
Example:

Keeping a local copy of a "Currency Exchange Rates" table in Azure SQL while the full dataset is in Snowflake.
2. Moderate Deviation (Some risks, but manageable)
Scenario:

Migrating from SQL Server on AWS to Snowflake in Azure.
Most operational tables are migrated, but some high-frequency transactional tables remain in an Azure SQL Database, as certain applications cannot yet be refactored to query Snowflake.
A data pipeline refreshes Snowflake every 15 minutes with the latest updates.
Justification:

Some data latency risks but acceptable for near real-time reporting.
Added complexity in managing two databases, but a clear migration roadmap exists.
Example:

Keeping real-time customer orders in Azure SQL while migrating historical orders to Snowflake.
3. High Deviation (Significant risk, requires strong justification)
Scenario:

Migrating from DB2 on IBM Cloud to Google BigQuery, but financial transaction tables remain in Azure SQL due to dependencies with an external payment gateway.
Multiple ETL jobs run hourly to keep data synchronized, but integrity issues arise due to delayed updates across systems.
Some applications query both databases separately, leading to complex join operations.
Justification:

Increased risk of inconsistent data between systems.
High operational overhead in managing multiple sync jobs.
Future scalability concerns if not fully migrated.
Example:

Keeping customer payments and refunds in Azure SQL while customer and order data are in BigQuery, leading to challenges in unified reporting.
4. Critical Deviation (Severe misalignment, strong risk)
Scenario:

A company plans to migrate from SAP HANA (hosted on Azure) to Snowflake, but only a subset of analytical tables are migrated.
The majority of critical operational tables (customer, orders, inventory, transactions) remain in Azure SQL, with no structured data synchronization.
Applications must query both systems independently, leading to fragmented data access and performance bottlenecks.
Justification:

No clear data governance strategy, making it impossible to maintain a single source of truth.
Performance and security risks due to multiple, unstructured queries between databases.
High risk of project failure due to incomplete migration.
Example:

Migrating only aggregated sales data to Snowflake while detailed transactions, customer records, and invoices remain in Azure SQL, making it impossible to generate unified reports without complex and inefficient cross-database queries.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Low Deviation

Example:
An archival table containing historical audit logs is migrated as a local copy in the cloud.
Justification:
The divisional principles emphasize integrated, up‑to‑date operational data. However, since audit logs are used solely for historical compliance and rarely impact live operations, keeping them as a local copy is an acceptable minor deviation. The limited operational impact justifies this approach.
Moderate Deviation

Example:
A configuration table (storing application settings or metadata) is maintained as a local copy with scheduled nightly updates instead of real‑time synchronization.
Justification:
Divisional architecture principles call for timely, consistent data for smooth operations. Although configuration data ideally should be integrated, the infrequent changes and low criticality mean that a scheduled update introduces only a slight delay. The moderate deviation is justified by the low risk of impacting system performance while still maintaining overall functional alignment.
High Deviation

Example:
A key lookup table (such as part of a product catalog) is migrated as a local copy without real‑time synchronization, leading to occasional data mismatches between the cloud and integrated systems.
Justification:
Divisional principles require unified, real‑time data across divisions to support critical business processes. The lack of synchronization here causes significant discrepancies that can affect decision‑making and customer-facing operations. This level of deviation is high because the inconsistency directly challenges the principle of integrated, consistent data—prompting the need for corrective measures.
Critical Deviation

Example:
A core transactional table (holding live customer orders or financial transactions) is available only as a static local copy in the cloud with no automated synchronization mechanism.
Justification:
For core operational data, divisional architecture principles mandate immediate consistency and real‑time integration. Relying solely on a local copy for transactional data poses severe risks—such as order duplication, billing errors, or compliance breaches—that could jeopardize the entire business operation. This critical deviation demands urgent remediation to restore full alignment with the divisional principles.

=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
### deviation from divisional architecture 
Low Deviation ---------------

Justification: The deviation is minor because it involves data that is non-essential to real‑time operations and does not compromise the overall integrity or consistency demanded by the divisional architecture principles. Such data typically serves historical or archival purposes where strict real‑time integration is not required.

Example: An archival table for historical audit logs is migrated as a local copy in the cloud. Since these logs are only used for periodic compliance reviews and do not impact daily operations, this deviation is minimal.

Moderate Deviation ------------------------

Justification: The deviation is noticeable but limited to supporting or configuration data that changes infrequently. Although divisional architecture principles call for integrated and up‑to‑date data, the delay in synchronization for non-critical data introduces only a minor risk, which is acceptable given its low impact on operational performance.

Example: A configuration table (storing application settings and metadata) is maintained as a local copy in the cloud and synchronized on a nightly basis. The slight delay is acceptable because these settings rarely change and do not disrupt the core functionality.

High Deviation -----------------------

Justification: The deviation is significant when it involves data that is integral to supporting key business processes. Divisional architecture principles expect consistent, real‑time data flow; any delay or isolation in such data can lead to noticeable inconsistencies and misalignments, which could impact decision‑making and operational effectiveness.

Example: A key lookup table for a product catalog is migrated as a local copy without real‑time updates. This leads to occasional mismatches in product details across integrated systems, affecting inventory management and customer-facing applications—an outcome that significantly deviates from the intended architectural consistency.

Critical Deviation ----------------------

Justification: The deviation is severe when it affects core transactional data that drives real‑time business operations and compliance. Divisional architecture principles mandate full integration and immediate synchronization for such data. Failing to meet these standards poses immediate operational, financial, and regulatory risks, requiring urgent corrective action.

Example: A customer orders table, which contains live transactional data, is available only as a local copy in the cloud without any automated synchronization. This can result in order duplication, billing errors, and fulfillment delays, directly jeopardizing business integrity and regulatory compliance.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
# Deviation from divisional target state architecture

1. Low Deviation

Justification: A minor deviation that does not substantially impact the alignment with the divisional target state architecture. This could be a temporary workaround or a non-essential component that does not alter the overall system design, security standards, or performance goals.

Example: Some non-critical tables, such as historical data or archived logs, are temporarily stored as local copies in the cloud while waiting for full migration. This does not affect the integrity or scalability of the core cloud architecture and can be resolved in the next phase of migration.

Impact on Target Architecture: The deviation has minimal to no long-term impact on the divisional target state architecture, as it’s a temporary arrangement to keep the system running while waiting for full migration.

2. Moderate Deviation

Justification: A moderate deviation where elements deviate from the target state architecture, but the system still functions with manageable performance impacts. While the deviation affects some functionality, it does not compromise critical system components or security standards.

Example: Reporting tables and less-critical transactional tables are split between the on-premises environment and cloud-based local copies, causing some performance issues when cross-referencing. Data synchronization between the two environments adds slight latency to reporting processes, but operations continue without major service disruptions.

Impact on Target Architecture: The architecture is somewhat disrupted, but the issue is contained and manageable. There is a delay in fully achieving the divisional target state, but no core functions are affected.

3. High Deviation

Justification: A significant deviation where key elements of the target architecture are not properly implemented, affecting performance, security, or functionality. The deviation may lead to inefficiencies or compliance issues and will require immediate corrective action to align with the divisional target state.

Example: Critical tables that support core transactional processes or real-time analytics remain as local copies in the cloud, leading to slow data access and integration issues between cloud and local copies. This causes delays in processing high-priority operations and may introduce data consistency issues, which affect business processes.

Impact on Target Architecture: The deviation significantly hampers the architecture’s intended performance and scalability goals. It deviates from the target state, as a cloud-first design was the goal. Corrective action is required to migrate these critical tables to the cloud for proper data centralization and efficiency.

4. Critical Deviation

Justification: A critical deviation where fundamental components of the target architecture are not met, creating substantial risks for system stability, security, or business continuity. This level requires immediate action and remediation to align the system with the divisional target state.

Example: Core application tables that are essential for processing business transactions and ensuring data consistency are left as local copies in the cloud. This results in a major system failure or an outage due to failed data synchronization between the cloud and the local copies, preventing access to critical business data. This could also lead to security vulnerabilities or data integrity issues.

Impact on Target Architecture: The deviation represents a critical breach of the target architecture’s principles, as the cloud architecture is not fully realized. The deviation poses immediate risks to operational continuity, data integrity, and compliance, requiring urgent resolution.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
### architecture-related policy violation

1. Low

Justification: A minor deviation from the architecture-related policy, often related to scheduling or non-critical data elements. The deviation has minimal impact on the overall system architecture, and the cloud integration can still function without significant issues.

Example: The migration plan deviates from the original target architecture because a few historical or reference tables have not yet been migrated to the cloud. These tables are not essential for real-time operations or business processes and can be handled by temporary local copies in the cloud.

Impact: No immediate system impact; temporary solution in place to maintain functionality.
2. Moderate

Justification: A moderate deviation occurs when there’s a misalignment with the architecture policy that impacts integration or operational processes. The deviation could be related to a critical group of tables that should be in the cloud but remain on a local copy, leading to data mismatches or slight inefficiencies in integration.

Example: Several non-transactional tables were intended to be fully migrated to the cloud as part of a single migration, but some are still left behind in a local cloud copy. This creates a slight delay in cloud integration, causing data inconsistencies between the cloud system and local copies used for integration or reporting.

Impact: Minor disruptions in reporting or analytics, requiring adjustments but not causing significant issues in overall system functionality.

3. High

Justification: A significant policy violation that impacts essential parts of the architecture, such as cloud-native integration, data synchronization, or operational integrity. This type of violation compromises real-time data access or performance.

Example: Key transactional or customer-related tables (e.g., order details or inventory data) are left behind in the local copy while other data is migrated to the cloud. This leads to real-time data inconsistencies, affecting system operations such as customer transactions, order fulfillment, or service delivery. Cloud integration cannot operate optimally due to the missing critical data in the cloud.

Impact: Disruption to key business processes like order processing or customer service, requiring urgent corrective action to realign with the cloud architecture.

4. Critical

Justification: A severe violation of architecture principles that causes a fundamental breakdown in the cloud system's ability to meet business needs. The architecture is significantly compromised, leading to operational failure, security risks, or severe compliance issues.

Example: Entire sets of critical operational tables (e.g., payroll, financial records, or user authentication) are missed during migration and are left as local copies. The cloud architecture is now incomplete, leading to system failures or inability to process core functions like payroll or customer account management, resulting in financial loss or significant operational downtime.

Impact: Complete breakdown of business-critical functions, causing major operational disruption and potential financial or legal risks. Immediate remediation is necessary to restore the system’s functionality.

=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
###  IT technology dependency

1. Low IT Technology Dependency

Justification: In this level, technology plays a minimal role in business processes. Migration to the cloud might be happening, but the systems or data involved aren’t critical to the core business functions. Any disruption or delay in migrating these tables won’t impact day-to-day operations significantly.

Example: A set of reference data or archive tables (e.g., historical reports, logs, or non-sensitive data) are migrated to the cloud, while some of the tables (like those with older data that is infrequently accessed) remain in local copies. Since this data isn’t actively used in real-time operations, the dependency on the cloud is low.

2. Moderate IT Technology Dependency

Justification: Technology is more involved in core processes, but these processes can tolerate some disruptions or delays. Some local data tables might still be used temporarily as the migration continues, and business operations might see slight inefficiencies or delays. While it’s important, the business can adapt to short-term issues without major setbacks.

Example: Customer data for analysis or inventory levels are partially migrated to the cloud, but some critical tables like inventory quantities remain local. The cloud-based system updates regularly, but because the local data might not be in sync, there could be minor delays in fulfilling orders or slightly outdated inventory numbers. Operations can continue, but the lack of full integration will cause minor inefficiencies.

3. High IT Technology Dependency

Justification: At this level, technology is crucial to most business processes, and any interruptions in the integration of cloud and local data will have a tangible impact. Key business functions are affected, and although the business can still operate, it risks significant delays or data inaccuracies, which may affect customer experience, revenue, or productivity.

Example: In this case, essential transactional data such as customer orders, product availability, or financial transactions is being migrated. Some tables remain local (such as real-time order status updates or financial logs). If this local data is not synchronized properly with the cloud, it could result in delays in processing customer orders or even lead to errors in billing. The business is still functional but faces risk due to inconsistency in critical data between the cloud and local storage.

4. Critical IT Technology Dependency

Justification: At this level, the entire business hinges on the proper and seamless functioning of technology. If migration is incomplete or data is inconsistent between local and cloud environments, it can bring down core business processes, causing financial, operational, or compliance-related consequences. Full migration and real-time integration are necessary for business continuity.

Example: Core systems like order processing, real-time customer management, and financial operations rely heavily on up-to-date data from the cloud. Local copies of key transactional tables (such as current customer orders, inventory levels, or real-time accounting data) are critical for processing transactions smoothly. If the migration is incomplete or cloud data isn’t integrated seamlessly with the local copies, it could result in a halt in customer orders, financial reporting failures, or major service disruptions. This level of dependency would jeopardize the business’s ability to operate efficiently and comply with regulations.
