1. Low Deviation (Minor impact, aligns with strategy)
Scenario:

A company is migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL.
Most tables are migrated, but some small lookup/reference tables are kept locally in an application’s embedded SQLite database for faster access.
These local copies are read-only and synchronized periodically from the PostgreSQL database.
Justification:

No impact on data integrity or system performance.
The approach is within best practices and doesn’t introduce complexity.
Example:

Keeping a local copy of a "Country Codes" table in an application database for quick lookups while the primary data resides in PostgreSQL

2. Moderate Deviation (Some risks, but manageable)
Scenario:

Migrating from Sybase ASE to Microsoft SQL Server.
Most transactional tables are migrated, but a subset of reporting tables is retained in Sybase for legacy applications.
An ETL job refreshes the SQL Server data, but reports generated from Sybase may have slight delays.
Justification:

Some data latency risks, but acceptable for non-real-time reporting.
Requires additional maintenance for synchronization.
Example:

Keeping historical sales reports in Sybase while migrating real-time sales transactions to SQL Server.
3. High Deviation (Significant risk, requires strong justification)
Scenario:

Migrating from DB2 to MySQL for cost efficiency.
Key operational tables are migrated, but some financial transaction tables remain in DB2 due to third-party integrations.
Multiple complex data movement scripts are required to ensure consistency.
Justification:

Increased complexity and operational overhead.
Higher risk of data inconsistency between databases.
Might cause issues in reconciliation and reporting.
Example:

Keeping invoices and payment transactions in DB2 while migrating customer and order data to MySQL, leading to complex joins across databases.
4. Critical Deviation (Severe misalignment, strong risk)
Scenario:

Migrating from SAP HANA to PostgreSQL, but only a small subset of tables is moved.
The majority of business-critical tables (e.g., customer, orders, payments) remain in SAP HANA with no structured synchronization process.
Applications must query both databases separately, leading to fragmented data access and poor performance.
Justification:

High operational risk due to lack of integration.
No clear data governance strategy.
Increased technical debt, making future migrations difficult.
Example:

Migrating only customer profile data to PostgreSQL while keeping order and transaction history in SAP HANA, making it impossible to generate unified reports without multiple manual queries.

1. Low Deviation (Minor impact, aligns with strategy)
Scenario:

A company is migrating from Oracle (hosted in AWS RDS) to Snowflake.
Most tables are migrated to Snowflake, but some lookup/reference tables are kept as local copies in an Azure SQL Database for a specific reporting tool that is not yet connected to Snowflake.
These tables are small, read-only, and synchronized nightly.
Justification:

No major impact on performance, security, or maintainability.
Temporary workaround that aligns with the long-term migration plan.
Example:

Keeping a local copy of a "Currency Exchange Rates" table in Azure SQL while the full dataset is in Snowflake.
2. Moderate Deviation (Some risks, but manageable)
Scenario:

Migrating from SQL Server on AWS to Snowflake in Azure.
Most operational tables are migrated, but some high-frequency transactional tables remain in an Azure SQL Database, as certain applications cannot yet be refactored to query Snowflake.
A data pipeline refreshes Snowflake every 15 minutes with the latest updates.
Justification:

Some data latency risks but acceptable for near real-time reporting.
Added complexity in managing two databases, but a clear migration roadmap exists.
Example:

Keeping real-time customer orders in Azure SQL while migrating historical orders to Snowflake.
3. High Deviation (Significant risk, requires strong justification)
Scenario:

Migrating from DB2 on IBM Cloud to Google BigQuery, but financial transaction tables remain in Azure SQL due to dependencies with an external payment gateway.
Multiple ETL jobs run hourly to keep data synchronized, but integrity issues arise due to delayed updates across systems.
Some applications query both databases separately, leading to complex join operations.
Justification:

Increased risk of inconsistent data between systems.
High operational overhead in managing multiple sync jobs.
Future scalability concerns if not fully migrated.
Example:

Keeping customer payments and refunds in Azure SQL while customer and order data are in BigQuery, leading to challenges in unified reporting.
4. Critical Deviation (Severe misalignment, strong risk)
Scenario:

A company plans to migrate from SAP HANA (hosted on Azure) to Snowflake, but only a subset of analytical tables are migrated.
The majority of critical operational tables (customer, orders, inventory, transactions) remain in Azure SQL, with no structured data synchronization.
Applications must query both systems independently, leading to fragmented data access and performance bottlenecks.
Justification:

No clear data governance strategy, making it impossible to maintain a single source of truth.
Performance and security risks due to multiple, unstructured queries between databases.
High risk of project failure due to incomplete migration.
Example:

Migrating only aggregated sales data to Snowflake while detailed transactions, customer records, and invoices remain in Azure SQL, making it impossible to generate unified reports without complex and inefficient cross-database queries.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Low Deviation

Example:
An archival table containing historical audit logs is migrated as a local copy in the cloud.
Justification:
The divisional principles emphasize integrated, up‑to‑date operational data. However, since audit logs are used solely for historical compliance and rarely impact live operations, keeping them as a local copy is an acceptable minor deviation. The limited operational impact justifies this approach.
Moderate Deviation

Example:
A configuration table (storing application settings or metadata) is maintained as a local copy with scheduled nightly updates instead of real‑time synchronization.
Justification:
Divisional architecture principles call for timely, consistent data for smooth operations. Although configuration data ideally should be integrated, the infrequent changes and low criticality mean that a scheduled update introduces only a slight delay. The moderate deviation is justified by the low risk of impacting system performance while still maintaining overall functional alignment.
High Deviation

Example:
A key lookup table (such as part of a product catalog) is migrated as a local copy without real‑time synchronization, leading to occasional data mismatches between the cloud and integrated systems.
Justification:
Divisional principles require unified, real‑time data across divisions to support critical business processes. The lack of synchronization here causes significant discrepancies that can affect decision‑making and customer-facing operations. This level of deviation is high because the inconsistency directly challenges the principle of integrated, consistent data—prompting the need for corrective measures.
Critical Deviation

Example:
A core transactional table (holding live customer orders or financial transactions) is available only as a static local copy in the cloud with no automated synchronization mechanism.
Justification:
For core operational data, divisional architecture principles mandate immediate consistency and real‑time integration. Relying solely on a local copy for transactional data poses severe risks—such as order duplication, billing errors, or compliance breaches—that could jeopardize the entire business operation. This critical deviation demands urgent remediation to restore full alignment with the divisional principles.

=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Low Deviation ---------------

Justification: The deviation is minor because it involves data that is non-essential to real‑time operations and does not compromise the overall integrity or consistency demanded by the divisional architecture principles. Such data typically serves historical or archival purposes where strict real‑time integration is not required.

Example: An archival table for historical audit logs is migrated as a local copy in the cloud. Since these logs are only used for periodic compliance reviews and do not impact daily operations, this deviation is minimal.

Moderate Deviation ------------------------

Justification: The deviation is noticeable but limited to supporting or configuration data that changes infrequently. Although divisional architecture principles call for integrated and up‑to‑date data, the delay in synchronization for non-critical data introduces only a minor risk, which is acceptable given its low impact on operational performance.

Example: A configuration table (storing application settings and metadata) is maintained as a local copy in the cloud and synchronized on a nightly basis. The slight delay is acceptable because these settings rarely change and do not disrupt the core functionality.

High Deviation -----------------------

Justification: The deviation is significant when it involves data that is integral to supporting key business processes. Divisional architecture principles expect consistent, real‑time data flow; any delay or isolation in such data can lead to noticeable inconsistencies and misalignments, which could impact decision‑making and operational effectiveness.

Example: A key lookup table for a product catalog is migrated as a local copy without real‑time updates. This leads to occasional mismatches in product details across integrated systems, affecting inventory management and customer-facing applications—an outcome that significantly deviates from the intended architectural consistency.

Critical Deviation ----------------------

Justification: The deviation is severe when it affects core transactional data that drives real‑time business operations and compliance. Divisional architecture principles mandate full integration and immediate synchronization for such data. Failing to meet these standards poses immediate operational, financial, and regulatory risks, requiring urgent corrective action.

Example: A customer orders table, which contains live transactional data, is available only as a local copy in the cloud without any automated synchronization. This can result in order duplication, billing errors, and fulfillment delays, directly jeopardizing business integrity and regulatory compliance.
