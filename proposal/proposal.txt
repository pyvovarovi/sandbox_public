Database migration and integration project involves migrating all tables to Snowflake on the cloud, but some tables will also be available in the cloud as a local copy.

Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture: Low to Moderate

Since all tables are migrated to Snowflake, the architecture is mostly aligned with cloud adoption.
If maintaining local copies is a temporary or strategic decision, the deviation remains Low to Moderate.
Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy: Low to Moderate

If Snowflake aligns with the divisional cloud strategy, deviation is Low.
If maintaining local copies conflicts with the cloud-first approach, it might be Moderate.
Technology Dependency: High

The system depends on Snowflake and possibly data replication or integration processes for local copies.
If real-time or frequent synchronization is needed, dependency remains High.
IT Technology Dependency: High

The organization relies on Snowflake for core database operations.
Any additional tools or services for integration (ETL, data pipelines) increase dependency.
Economic Impact and Internal Technology Investment: Moderate to High

Cloud costs (compute, storage, data transfer) are involved.
If maintaining local copies adds operational complexity, costs increase, pushing this toward High.

================================================================================================================================
hybrid migration approach, where partial data resides in both the cloud and on-premises. Are you considering replication, event-driven synchronization, or another method to keep consistency between the two environments? Also, do you have a strategy for minimizing latency and ensuring data integrity across both locations?

primarily falls into the following categories based on your organization's classification:

Deviation from Divisional Target State Architecture: Moderate to High

Since not all tables are migrated in a single move, the architecture is in a transitional state.
If the hybrid model is temporary and aligns with the target architecture, the deviation may be Moderate.
If the hybrid model is long-term or differs significantly from the target state, it could be High.
Deviation from Divisional Technology Strategy: Moderate to High

If the divisional strategy supports phased migrations, the deviation is likely Moderate.
If the strategy favors a full migration with no local copies, then maintaining partial on-premises data could be a High deviation.
Technology Dependency: High to Critical

The system relies on both on-premises and cloud environments, requiring data synchronization, connectivity, and performance considerations.
If local copies are needed for critical workloads, the dependency is closer to Critical.
IT Technology Dependency: High

The migration depends on database replication, integration patterns, and cloud services.
If a significant portion of the application depends on real-time or batch synchronization, the dependency remains High.
Economic Impact and Internal Technology Investment: Moderate to High

Cloud migrations generally involve investment in cloud resources, data transfer, and ongoing maintenance.
If keeping local copies requires additional infrastructure, costs could push this category toward High.
