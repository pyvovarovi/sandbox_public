| **Deviation Level** | **Example** | **Potential Impact** | **Remediation Priority** |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Low** | A legacy data movement tool used only in development or testing environments for non-critical file transfers. | Minor glitches or performance issues; isolated to non-production environments with no immediate business impact. | Monitor the tool and plan for its replacement during routine upgrades. |
| **Moderate** | An unsupported framework deployed in a staging environment for transferring data between legacy systems, with occasional failures or delays. | Could cause sporadic inconsistencies or delays during testing; not affecting production yet but raising concerns if promoted. | Prioritize migration planning and conduct controlled tests with a supported alternative. |
| **High** | The unsupported framework is in active use in production for batch processing between major internal systems. | Frequent errors, data integrity issues, and performance bottlenecks impacting key operational processes. | Accelerate the transition to a supported solution and implement temporary workarounds. |
| **Critical** | A core, unsupported data movement solution handling sensitive or real-time data transfers (e.g., customer transactions or regulated data) across production systems. | Severe security vulnerabilities, compliance risks, and potential for major operational disruptions, leading to immediate risk to business continuity. | Urgent replacement with a robust, supported framework and immediate risk mitigation measures. |
