### Internal Technology Investment

| Level    | Example                                                                                             | Explanation                                                                                                                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | **Minimal maintenance via internal scripts** <br> *Basic upkeep of a simple unsupported data sync tool.* | Requires very few resources; a low-complexity solution maintained with routine internal efforts.                                        |
| **Moderate** | **Add-on data movement module** <br> *A custom-developed module that integrates with existing systems.*  | Demands a moderate level of development and testing to ensure compatibility and reliability within a limited scope.                       |
| **High**     | **Robust custom framework with middleware** <br> *An unsupported solution built with dedicated middleware components.* | Involves significant investment in development and testing across multiple teams; complex integration and resource-intensive.            |
| **Critical** | **Strategic overhaul replacing core systems** <br> *A custom unsupported data movement framework designed to replace legacy systems.* | Represents a critical, long-term investment; success is pivotal for maintaining competitiveness and operational stability, requiring extensive resources and risk management. |

Below is a table with examples for a data consolidation strategy across the four levels. Each row includes a specific example and an explanation of its scope and impact.

| Level    | Example                                                                                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | **Consolidating isolated Excel files** <br>*Organize legacy spreadsheets into a shared drive.*       | Minimal effort to centralize non-critical, archival data. Improves accessibility without significant integration or cost.                                |
| **Moderate** | **Combining departmental databases** <br>*Merge data from several departments into a unified repository for periodic reporting.* | Streamlines data access for select teams, offering noticeable efficiency gains with a moderate investment in integration and process changes.             |
| **High**     | **Building an enterprise data warehouse** <br>*Integrate data from multiple operational systems into a centralized repository.*    | Provides comprehensive analytics by unifying key operational data. Requires substantial integration work and resources, significantly impacting decision-making. |
| **Critical** | **Implementing a real-time unified data platform** <br>*Deploy an enterprise-wide platform that consolidates live data feeds across all systems.* | A transformative strategy essential for strategic decision-making and operational excellence. Involves high investment and risk management due to its critical role.  |

These examples illustrate how a data consolidation strategy can scale from simple, low-impact projects to transformative, enterprise-wide initiatives.

Below is a table with examples for architecture component selection across four levels. Each row includes a specific example and an explanation of its scope and impact.

| Level    | Example                                                                                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | **Selecting a basic logging library** <br>*E.g., choosing a standard open-source logger.*       | A low-risk decision involving non-critical components. The selection requires minimal evaluation since the impact on overall architecture is limited.                 |
| **Moderate** | **Evaluating an API gateway for microservices** <br>*E.g., comparing open-source options for API management.* | A moderately impactful decision that affects service integration. It requires balancing features and performance while being supported by a mid-level evaluation process. |
| **High**     | **Choosing a middleware messaging system** <br>*E.g., selecting a robust message broker for internal communication.*  | A significant decision that influences system reliability and performance. The chosen component will integrate multiple systems, demanding thorough evaluation and testing. |
| **Critical** | **Selecting a core data storage engine** <br>*E.g., choosing a high-performance database system for mission-critical transactions.* | A foundational decision that directly affects system scalability, security, and resilience. This component selection is pivotal to the long-term success of the architecture.  |

These examples illustrate how architecture component selection can scale from low-risk, routine choices to critical, strategic decisions that shape the overall system design.
