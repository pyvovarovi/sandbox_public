| **Deviation Level** | **Example** | **Explanation** |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Low**             | Selecting a slightly older but stable version of a web framework that still meets all core requirements. | The component deviates minimally from the target state. Itâ€™s supported, compatible, and can be upgraded later with little impact. |
| **Moderate**        | Using a middleware library that supports most, but not all, required protocols, necessitating additional adapters or configuration. | The component is functional but requires extra integration work, reflecting a partial misalignment with the target state. |
| **High**            | Opting for a database system that diverges from the approved technology stack, potentially affecting scalability and performance. | The choice introduces significant misalignment. It impacts key architectural principles and may require considerable refactoring. |
| **Critical**        | Implementing a security component that lacks mandatory encryption standards and compliance features. | This deviation creates immediate risks to data integrity and regulatory compliance, demanding urgent remediation. |
