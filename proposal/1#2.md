Below is a structured, technical response that refines the scenario, defines deviation levels, and lists targeted questions with examples to help a business owner justify each level of deviation.

## 1. Project Overview & Migration Strategy

- **Scenario Context:**  
  - **Database Migration:** The project involves migrating databases to the cloud with a two-process approach.  
    - **Primary Migration:** Certain tables are migrated directly to the target cloud environment.  
    - **Secondary Process:** Other tables are maintained as a local copy and are migrated using an alternative process.  
  - **Target System:** All tables—regardless of migration method—will eventually be available in Snowflake, serving as the centralized analytical and reporting platform.
  
- **Architectural Impact:**  
  - **Data Consistency & Lineage:** Multiple migration processes may introduce discrepancies in data freshness, consistency, and the overall lineage of data across systems.
  - **Integration Complexity:** Varying migration approaches may impact the uniformity of data integration, affecting downstream analytics and business intelligence.

## 2. Deviation Levels from Divisional Architecture Principles

Each deviation level reflects a different impact on the established divisional architecture principles. Here is a concise definition of each:

- **Low Deviation:**  
  - Minor changes with limited impact on architecture.  
  - The system largely remains in line with divisional principles.

- **Moderate Deviation:**  
  - Noticeable alterations that introduce potential integration challenges.  
  - May affect data consistency, performance, or operational alignment.

- **High Deviation:**  
  - Significant architectural compromises affecting core business functions.  
  - Raises concerns about scalability, reliability, or data integrity.

- **Critical Deviation:**  
  - Severe deviations that could undermine business continuity, security, and compliance.  
  - Potentially lead to major operational risks and require immediate remediation.

## 3. Justification Questions & Examples for Each Deviation Level

### **Low Deviation**

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *"What minor adjustments have been made to accommodate the dual migration process?"*  
  - *"Are the changes limited to non-critical tables or metadata modifications?"*  
  - *"Do the current differences have negligible impact on data refresh and reporting cycles?"*

- **Examples:**  
  - Adjustments in naming conventions or metadata tagging that do not alter data flow.  
  - Minimal data replication or delay (e.g., non-critical historical data) that doesn’t affect core analytics.

---

### **Moderate Deviation**

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *"Which specific tables or datasets are affected by the dual migration, and how do these changes impact data latency?"*  
  - *"Are there identified discrepancies in data definitions between the two migration processes?"*  
  - *"How will the differences in migration impact integration points with downstream systems in Snowflake?"*

- **Examples:**  
  - Partial data duplication causing moderate delays in reporting cycles.  
  - Slight differences in data schema or refresh frequencies that require additional data validation steps.

---

### **High Deviation**

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *"What core business processes are affected by the inconsistencies introduced by the two migration approaches?"*  
  - *"How do these architectural compromises affect cross-functional dependencies and data lineage?"*  
  - *"Have we identified any potential risks in the integration architecture that might lead to data quality issues?"*

- **Examples:**  
  - Critical operational data residing in locally copied tables leading to potential mismatches with cloud data.  
  - Increased complexity in tracing data provenance, affecting audits and compliance checks.

---

### **Critical Deviation**

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *"Which deviations have the potential to disrupt business continuity or compromise security and compliance?"*  
  - *"What is the risk of non-compliance with regulatory standards due to inconsistent data integration?"*  
  - *"How are we mitigating severe risks related to data integrity and system availability?"*

- **Examples:**  
  - Inconsistent data across migration processes that leads to unreliable reporting, directly affecting critical decision-making.  
  - Major architectural breaches (e.g., loss of transactional integrity or compromised security boundaries) requiring immediate remediation.

## 4. Integration Considerations & Follow-Up Actions

- **Impact Analysis:**  
  - Conduct a detailed impact analysis on how each deviation level affects key areas like data consistency, performance, security, and compliance.
  
- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  - **Low to Moderate:** Implement monitoring and validation routines to catch minor discrepancies early.  
  - **High to Critical:** Develop contingency plans and remediation processes, such as real-time data synchronization, enhanced validation protocols, and emergency rollback plans.

- **Continuous Review:**  
  - Schedule periodic reviews with business owners to reassess deviation levels as the integration evolves, ensuring alignment with business priorities and divisional architecture principles.

This structured approach provides clear, actionable questions and real-world examples that help validate each deviation level. It ensures that the business owner is engaged in a dialogue about the architectural implications of the migration strategy and facilitates decision-making on necessary mitigations.
