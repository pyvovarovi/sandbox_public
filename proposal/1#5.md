Below is a structured, technical response that outlines the scenario, defines the dependency levels, and provides detailed questions—with examples—to help justify each level to the business owner.

### I. Project Context and Overview

- **Scenario Overview:**  
  The current project involves a database migration and integration into the cloud. Not all tables are migrated in a single pass; instead, some tables are transitioned as local copies via a secondary process. Ultimately, every table will be accessible in Snowflake. This hybrid approach requires careful evaluation of data synchronization, consistency, and potential operational impact.

- **Integration Considerations:**  
  - **Data Consistency:** Ensuring local copies remain aligned with primary sources.  
  - **Latency & Timeliness:** Evaluating how the migration schedule impacts data freshness.  
  - **Risk Management:** Identifying potential risks in phased migrations and planning appropriate contingency measures.

### II. IT Technology Dependency Levels

- **Defined Levels:**  
  1. **Low**  
  2. **Moderate**  
  3. **High**  
  4. **Critical**

- **Purpose:**  
  These levels categorize tables based on their operational significance, the impact of downtime or delays, and the associated risk in a cloud environment. They drive prioritization in migration efforts, backup strategies, and overall system resilience.

### III. Questions & Examples to Justify Each Dependency Level

#### 1. Low Dependency

- **Key Considerations:**  
  Data with minimal impact on daily operations, often used for historical analysis or non-critical reporting.

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *Usage Frequency:* “How frequently is this table accessed by business users?”  
  - *Impact of Unavailability:* “What are the consequences if this data is temporarily unavailable or delayed?”  
  - *Purpose:* “Is this table primarily used for archival purposes or historical analysis?”

- **Examples:**  
  - Archival logs, historical records, or metadata tables that support background reporting rather than core operations.

---

#### 2. Moderate Dependency

- **Key Considerations:**  
  Data that supports routine operations and periodic reporting but is not essential for real-time processes.

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *Business Process Integration:* “Which business processes rely on this data, and how critical is its timely availability?”  
  - *Acceptable Delay:* “What is the acceptable latency for this data in our reporting or analytics workflows?”  
  - *Operational Impact:* “How does intermittent availability affect routine decision-making or analysis?”

- **Examples:**  
  - Data tables used for periodic performance reporting, scheduled analytics, or routine operational dashboards that tolerate minor delays.

---

#### 3. High Dependency

- **Key Considerations:**  
  Data essential for day-to-day operations, where delays or disruptions can have significant operational or revenue impacts.

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *Operational Impact:* “What is the impact on daily operations if this table experiences downtime or delays?”  
  - *Revenue & Customer Impact:* “How does this data support revenue-generating or customer-facing processes?”  
  - *Recovery Requirements:* “What are the expectations for backup, recovery, and data integrity for this table?”

- **Examples:**  
  - Transactional data supporting order processing, inventory management, or customer interactions where any disruption can directly affect service delivery.

---

#### 4. Critical Dependency

- **Key Considerations:**  
  Data that is indispensable to real-time operations, regulatory compliance, and overall business continuity, where any unavailability or error poses severe risks.

- **Questions to Ask:**  
  - *Risk & Impact:* “What are the potential financial, legal, or operational risks if this data is unavailable or compromised?”  
  - *Compliance & Security:* “What are the regulatory, security, and audit requirements for this data?”  
  - *Real-Time Needs:* “How would disruptions in this data flow affect real-time decision-making and customer trust?”

- **Examples:**  
  - Real-time transaction logs, financial records, personal or sensitive customer data, and any data integral to meeting regulatory or compliance standards.

### IV. Expanded Considerations and Action Points

- **Integration Strategy:**  
  - **Data Synchronization:** Develop strategies to ensure local copies remain in sync with the primary database until full migration is complete.  
  - **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring systems to quickly identify and respond to discrepancies or delays in data availability.

- **Risk Mitigation:**  
  - **Contingency Planning:** Prepare fallbacks for high and critical tables, including automated failover and recovery processes.  
  - **Impact Analysis:** Conduct regular business impact assessments (BIA) to adjust dependency classifications based on evolving business needs.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of dependency levels, migration schedules, and associated risk assessments.  
  - **Regular Updates:** Schedule frequent reviews with business owners to align on priorities and adjust processes as necessary.

- **Technical Alignment:**  
  - **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Define SLAs that reflect the dependency levels, ensuring that high and critical data receive the necessary uptime and performance guarantees.  
  - **Performance Metrics:** Establish metrics and KPIs for each level to monitor and report on migration success and system stability.

This refined structure should assist in clearly communicating the technical implications and operational risks associated with each dependency level while providing actionable questions and examples for business owners.
