Economic impact, internal technology investment. Low, moderate,  high, critical.
Below is a structured approach that integrates the current scenario, defines evaluation levels, and proposes 10 strategic questions—with examples—to help a business owner justify ratings for both economic impact and internal technology investment.

---

## 1. Overview of the Migration Scenario

**Current State:**  
- The migration project involves moving database tables to the cloud (Snowflake) using a two-step process.  
- Not all tables are migrated in the initial phase; some remain as local copies that are integrated later.  
- This hybrid approach necessitates careful planning to balance operational continuity with future scalability.

## 2. Evaluation Levels for Impact & Investment

Each dimension is rated on four levels:  
- **Low:** Minimal business disruption or cost; existing processes remain largely unaffected.  
- **Moderate:** Noticeable impact that may require some adjustments but remains manageable with current resources.  
- **High:** Significant changes needed; potential for considerable cost increases and process redesign.  
- **Critical:** Major impact with high risk; demands substantial technology investment, time, and strategic change to align with business objectives.

## 3. Strategic Questions for the Business Owner

Below are 10 questions designed to uncover insights on both economic impact and internal technology investment. Each question includes examples of responses that could justify the corresponding rating levels.

### **Question 1: What revenue improvements or cost savings do you anticipate as a direct result of migrating to Snowflake?**
- **Low:** Expected savings are marginal; current revenue streams and cost bases remain stable.  
- **Moderate:** Moderate savings are forecast due to streamlined data processing and modest performance gains.  
- **High:** Significant revenue boosts or cost reductions are expected from optimized query performance and reduced operational overhead.  
- **Critical:** The migration is seen as a transformative shift that will fundamentally alter revenue models or drastically cut costs, requiring major upfront investments.

---

### **Question 2: How will the mix of fully migrated and locally maintained tables affect operational efficiency?**
- **Low:** Minimal process change; legacy and cloud-based data co-exist with little impact on day-to-day operations.  
- **Moderate:** Some integration challenges are expected, requiring targeted process adjustments.  
- **High:** The dual approach will likely necessitate substantial re-engineering of workflows to maintain efficiency.  
- **Critical:** There is a risk of operational disruption that could lead to significant downtime or errors, demanding an extensive redesign of business processes.

---

### **Question 3: What are the potential risks associated with maintaining a hybrid data environment?**
- **Low:** Risk factors are well-understood and can be mitigated with existing procedures.  
- **Moderate:** Risks are present (e.g., synchronization issues) but can be managed with focused efforts.  
- **High:** The risk of data inconsistencies and increased maintenance effort is high, warranting additional investments in monitoring and reconciliation tools.  
- **Critical:** The hybrid setup could jeopardize data integrity and regulatory compliance, potentially incurring severe financial and reputational losses if not urgently addressed.

---

### **Question 4: How scalable is the current architecture, and how does it support future growth?**
- **Low:** The architecture supports current loads with minor adjustments needed for growth.  
- **Moderate:** Scalability is acceptable, but planned enhancements will be necessary as business demand increases.  
- **High:** The current model requires significant modifications to handle anticipated future growth and increased data volumes.  
- **Critical:** Without a major overhaul, the system’s scalability limitations could impede long-term strategic growth, requiring a critical level of investment in new infrastructure.

---

### **Question 5: What is the expected downtime or disruption during migration phases?**
- **Low:** Migration activities are designed to be nearly seamless, with negligible impact on business operations.  
- **Moderate:** Some planned downtime is anticipated, but it is manageable within existing contingency frameworks.  
- **High:** Extended or recurring downtime may impact critical business functions, demanding enhanced mitigation strategies.  
- **Critical:** Unplanned or severe disruptions are expected, potentially affecting customer service or revenue streams significantly, thus requiring immediate and significant process changes.

---

### **Question 6: How does the projected migration timeline and budget align with current resource allocations?**
- **Low:** The timeline and budget are well-aligned with current resources, with only minimal additional investment needed.  
- **Moderate:** Some extra resources will be necessary to meet deadlines, but overall alignment is reasonable.  
- **High:** The migration will strain existing budgets and timelines, necessitating substantial additional internal technology investment.  
- **Critical:** There is a significant misalignment, with the project likely to exceed both budget and schedule, forcing a strategic reallocation of resources and possibly external funding.

---

### **Question 7: How well does this migration strategy align with the long-term business strategy and technology roadmap?**
- **Low:** The strategy aligns closely with existing plans and requires only incremental adjustments.  
- **Moderate:** Alignment is generally good, though some modifications may be needed to fully integrate with future goals.  
- **High:** There are notable gaps between the current migration plan and the long-term vision, calling for higher investment in aligning the two.  
- **Critical:** The current strategy diverges significantly from long-term plans, posing risks that require a complete overhaul of the technology roadmap.

---

### **Question 8: What contingency measures are in place to address potential migration failures or delays?**
- **Low:** Robust, well-tested contingency plans exist, minimizing risk.  
- **Moderate:** Contingency measures are in place but may need refinement as the migration progresses.  
- **High:** Current plans are partially developed, indicating a need for significant improvement to handle possible issues.  
- **Critical:** There is a lack of effective contingency planning, exposing the business to high risk if migration issues occur, thus demanding urgent investment in risk mitigation strategies.

---

### **Question 9: How will data governance and regulatory compliance be managed during and after migration?**
- **Low:** Existing governance frameworks will suffice with minor updates; compliance impact is minimal.  
- **Moderate:** Some enhancements are needed to meet regulatory standards, but the overall impact is manageable.  
- **High:** The hybrid environment introduces complexities that require extensive compliance checks and upgrades to governance protocols.  
- **Critical:** Regulatory risks are substantial, potentially incurring heavy fines or operational restrictions if not addressed with a major compliance overhaul and significant internal investment.

---

### **Question 10: How will migration impact data access performance and end-user experience?**
- **Low:** Users will experience immediate performance improvements with little to no transition friction.  
- **Moderate:** Some users may experience transitional delays, but overall performance gains are expected over time.  
- **High:** Performance variability during migration could disrupt user experience, necessitating investment in optimization and support.  
- **Critical:** Significant degradation in data access and user experience is anticipated during transition phases, which could critically impact business operations unless addressed by a major technology upgrade.

## Final Thoughts

This structured set of questions is designed to prompt detailed insights from business stakeholders. By aligning responses with the defined impact levels—Low, Moderate, High, and Critical—business owners can better justify the level of economic impact and internal technology investment required for the migration project. This approach not only helps in risk assessment but also in securing the necessary resources and strategic support to ensure a smooth transition to a cloud-based data platform in Snowflake.
